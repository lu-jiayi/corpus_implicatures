1200:36	but if they're going --n40168b to offer these services, or these recorded message, everything, they ought --n4016ca to be stuck --n4016dd working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer --n40171c to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them.

1831:82	you know, come --n403ecb to think of it, i think that was a cover version of, like a john lee hooker song, or something,
1876:62	i me-, there was no reason for him to really come into, you know, great stardom or anything.
1999:3	or, uh,
2067:114	and i made a lotus spreadsheet and went through the year --n400249 using all of our, our checkbook --n40026c to figure out what we spent --n40028b each time and whether we were over or under for each month
2091:43	we've set a budget for each, you know, household expenses, or food, and clothing and entertainment and then our, our own fun money and just stuff like that
2098:3	or does it work out pretty well.
2115:136	if you can't stay, if something comes up and you can't stay within it then we have, uh, you know, a budget for, you know, like we call --n401af2 our slush fund or something
2163:48	so, we don't have any long term, you know, in stocks, or anything like that right now,
2169:3	or so much a pay check
2178:23	when i retired from there, or left --n40357e, i took the money i that i had --n4035ad in mine and put it in an i r a
2199:157	and they did an analysis --n40444a for us based on what we were putting --n404471 in and the time frame that we wanted --n404498 to look at --n4044ab, and then gave us a good idea back, you know, some good information --n4044fa back on whether or not we were going --n404525 to achieve those goals, and, or not, and what we needed --n404564 to do --n404573 so that we could achieve them and the money we could put --n4045ae in at what time.
2199:200	and they did an analysis --n40444a for us based on what we were putting --n404471 in and the time frame that we wanted --n404498 to look at --n4044ab, and then gave us a good idea back, you know, some good information --n4044fa back on whether or not we were going --n404525 to achieve those goals, and, or not, and what we needed --n404564 to do --n404573 so that we could achieve them and the money we could put --n4045ae in at what time.
2204:3	or not,
2216:172	that, that's the other financial thing i guess that we've done --n404ddf is with our life insurance is, since i'm at home now is, is figuring out, uh, what we would need --n404e4e if something happened to my husband, or what he would need --n404e85 if something happened to me,
2271:20	i don't take a subscription or anything like that.
2274:101	and, and, uh, kind of strange because i, it --n40109a's not unusual to, uh, see, uh, an engineering manual or something laying around the house
2400:31	you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other
2420:30	i need --n40534f to probably make a phone call or two.
2462:69	but if we're going --n400f75 to have a meeting, where we're having the attorneys --n400fa8 come in, or people from, uh, other party's attorneys and stuff --n400feb, then i normally dress up.
2491:40	when, uh, i was at t i --n401e41 the first year or so, we were sent out to our record retention facility --n401e84 to look through two thousand boxes.
2609:38	i had a friend who --n404c22 worked there for a year or so
2632:3	or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and, hair just this way.
2669:64	and we'd try, we'd try --n4065e2 to say, didn't you bring any pants or anything.
2700:39	but, you know, i don't know if they do or not.
2728:40	with the, you know, the little suspenders or something on
2734:3	or they're meeting with people that they know --n408447 is going --n408456 to be dressed --n408469 that way then that's how they are --n408490.
2747:3	or it would me, you know.
2792:8	weather-wise, or otherwise.
2827:3	or it feels cool --n400877 compared to yesterday, but very pleasant,
2851:13	the blue flu, or the white collar flu, depending on where you work --n401032, i guess.
2865:88	and if you look outside, you would like --n401403 to go out and mow your lawn, if you could go out and buy a new spark plug, or something along those lines,
2927:38	rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour --n4025d1. summer and winter,
3051:3	or,
3053:66	i'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area. if just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative,
3087:28	is that with regard to work place engineering, or just, you know, environm-, the work place environment
3088:3	or,
3096:47	and we monitor, um, anything that --n4059cb comes out of a stack, or out of a building,
3097:3	or, um, we do have customers that, um, --n405ae3 their concerns are in the work place
3154:67	and if, if anything --n406d0e ever happened, god forbid, you know, a building explosion or something tha-, we'd be able --n406d65 to track chemicals from that building with our weather station.
3162:28	and, um, do you like classic rock, or modern rock, or which kind.
3162:37	and, um, do you like classic rock, or modern rock, or which kind.
3173:3	or is it like,
3218:18	i listen to heavy metal or classic rock.
3422:78	and now you're singing all this stuff that, --n40493b doesn't matter what you, what you sing --n404966 or what you record --n40497d,
3547:62	the, the eighties are called --n406ca2, like the progressive years, or the, or, you know, like the technology years, because of all the computers and stuff.
3673:70	and, uh, you know, whenever we, he, my husband has time off or something --n40055f, we take them to the zoo,
3674:3	or we, you know, we do everything we can possibly --n4006ea as a family.
3698:227	we have, we try --n400f23 to spend like monday nights, we call it family home evening, and, have our kids, uh, you know, have little lessons with them, and, you know, just see, count, see how things are going --n400ff6 in our family and, you know, teach them about their grandparents or something like that. bring out pictures of them so they get --n401065 to know them
3723:3	or we go in the backyard and sit down
3745:70	you know the kids just think it --n40214d's wonderful just maybe to go --n402170 get an ice cream cone or, yeah, or, uh, you know, go --n4021bb get a bag of m and m's or something like that,
3745:79	you know the kids just think it --n40214d's wonderful just maybe to go --n402170 get an ice cream cone or, yeah, or, uh, you know, go --n4021bb get a bag of m and m's or something like that,
3745:126	you know the kids just think it --n40214d's wonderful just maybe to go --n402170 get an ice cream cone or, yeah, or, uh, you know, go --n4021bb get a bag of m and m's or something like that,
3752:96	our, our whole weekends are divi-, are devoted --n402651 to our children except for we might go out, you know, one evening or something,
3785:19	it was about a year or so ago, when we went --n403044.
3823:3	or they think it --n403d00's wonderful just --n403d13 to go to mcdonald's, you know,
4031:54	well, you know he was, when was it --n401af5, last year or year before last, he was voted --n401b28 the sexiest actor in movies, or something.
4031:101	well, you know he was, when was it --n401af5, last year or year before last, he was voted --n401b28 the sexiest actor in movies, or something.
4095:16	i read about two or three novels a week, in addition to all the technical stuff.
4286:19	i've never done aerobics or any sort of structured,
4299:52	and perhaps, it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun, or something like that.
4317:123	so, um, and i feel that way too as far as, you know, just sitting and doing, you know, to, the idea of doing fifty sit-ups or something, you know,
4439:81	um, in california there's, uh, almost an assumption, um, unless you're, sort of, clearly of an older generation --n403b8b, or something, you know, in your sixties, or something like that,
4439:108	um, in california there's, uh, almost an assumption, um, unless you're, sort of, clearly of an older generation --n403b8b, or something, you know, in your sixties, or something like that,
4480:38	you'll get organizations, like institutes for the whole health, or whatever.
4481:153	and, uh, oh the, the, the uni-, university of california at berkeley puts out the wellness letter. which --n404f25 is, uh, turned into a fairly well subscribed to, uh, newsletter, monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that
4481:159	and, uh, oh the, the, the uni-, university of california at berkeley puts out the wellness letter. which --n404f25 is, uh, turned into a fairly well subscribed to, uh, newsletter, monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that
4485:43	and, and, it doesn't deal with just exercise, or just stress management, or just diet, or anything.
4485:54	and, and, it doesn't deal with just exercise, or just stress management, or just diet, or anything.
4485:63	and, and, it doesn't deal with just exercise, or just stress management, or just diet, or anything.
4496:104	now do you think that's because they've realized that for whole health, that, the, you know, you have --n4058b8 to have that combination, or that people are motivated --n4058e7 that way so that they've incorporated that into their program.
4500:26	do you think the program came first or the,
4532:34	i'm not sure if it was a meditation practice, or if it was, you know, which --n40676a is similar to a stress management practice or alternates to, uh, a m a approved medicine.
4532:95	i'm not sure if it was a meditation practice, or if it was, you know, which --n40676a is similar to a stress management practice or alternates to, uh, a m a approved medicine.
4535:29	and more and more people start --n406aaa believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things --n406ae1,
4583:35	and they combine it with a, you know, meditation or whatever. some sort of relaxation
4682:83	but, um, it's very frustrating. and, even, even with health food stores and stores where you can buy natural products or, uh, organic, you know, materials, and foods and things --n409b40.
4707:15	north, south, east, or west.
4758:85	and, i've come to the conclusion, and this is a pretty scary thought to me, even, that if a guy is convicted --n4011ee, or a gal is convicted --n40120d, of a crime, rather than put them in prison, because prison's proven --n401258 not to work, just let them go.
4799:38	and they're still let --n401fb3 out on the street after one or two years.
4824:3	or, you know, there's other consequences rather than killing them, you know,
4874:87	you know, and you look at our society, almost everyone out on the street that --n40392f has been in prison, has been in prison three or four times.
4876:6	three or four times,
4951:3	or you can die.
4983:3	or what --n405b5b's even worse, is they promote them into a position that they can't handle --n405ba6 and let them get fired --n405bc1.
4987:13	or, one thing or the other.
5071:3	or is this mainly cross-stitching.
5202:30	i've been doing it for probably ten years or so.
5693:51	and they're asking like for a, uh, g p a of like three point seven or something like that.
5704:6	whether or not they get it is hard to say.
5766:10	they civilians or, uh, military.
5974:6	illegal or something like that,
6139:63	both, both in terms in ram as well as, uh, you know, standard memory or disk mem-, disk base,
6194:35	so. i don't know if you participate in that or not,
6291:93	i, i, fr-, you know, i, i debate about whether it's really good or not, you know.
6353:63	she said, now, do you all want him to go to a, a state college or a private college.
6363:73	it --n4059d8 amazes me how much the, the costs are going --n405a07 to go up over the next ten or fifteen years --n405a36.
6435:41	i don't even remember if it was in the dallasite --n4076a8 or the insite --n4076bb one, about uh, companies allowing you,
6465:51	uh, and, and i would certainly support something like four to one or five to one
6466:14	or, or, you know, maybe they want --n408720 to get generous and make it three to one.
6480:57	but it should be a standard and, and not left --n408a48 up to either the whim or the current overhead rate t-, uh, that --n408a8b's running in each department.
6505:69	the question was, um, what, what is your opinion of youth, uh, spending a year or two in, in public service --n4000a4.
6514:90	seems like there's so many kids that --n4004b4 don't have any since of, you know, what they want --n4004ef to be --n4004fe or do --n40050d
6515:3	or, you know, they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time
6625:69	i, i, i guess, in my own, having had the whole three or four minutes to, you know, give it a great deal of thought --n4031a8, you know, um, i, i think i agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary,
6629:3	or it can be,
6641:97	people that --n403795 might benefit most from it --n4037b0 might not go in that situation, you know, like people that --n4037eb really are trapped --n4037fe in a ghetto or something like that.
6720:119	really there could be, um, some scandals involved, if, you know, it wasn't people that --n405121 were really fair and le-, you know, in a legal way or something,
6724:57	they could send all the people over to, uh, you know, one particular part of town or one particular project, that somebody had paid somebody to, you know, get supported --n405390 --n405397,
6725:3	or,
6745:67	and they, they built, uh, can't think of a good example, a swimming pool, or anything, you know,
6772:70	you don't hear much on the news about young people really, you know, wanting --n4065c0 to do anything good or anything like that,
6833:28	but, uh, unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that, red cross, it was so many of them in it, that at any particular chance, your chance of having --n408533 to do something was, it was very slim.
6833:35	but, uh, unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that, red cross, it was so many of them in it, that at any particular chance, your chance of having --n408533 to do something was, it was very slim.
6904:85	well, um, with credit cards is, me, i, uh, i try --n400062 to get maybe just one or two,
6939:40	see they make money off of it, whether you use it or not.
7017:103	well the, the other thing some people are not aware of --n402341, is they will use their a, their credit card like their visa or their mastercard for cash
7047:48	i mean, i get, i get at least one or two a week. people, t-, you know, sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone
7047:104	i mean, i get, i get at least one or two a week. people, t-, you know, sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone
7184:87	if i could have, if i could make it on the road, i'd like --n4011c1 to play on like a bluegrass band or something,
7449:24	and whether you vote for one person or the other person, the issues is what, you know, what you believe in --n400632,
7486:45	they're real liberal now and to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago, um, the democrat party being liberal like they are now, you know, would never be thought of --n4019b0 --n4019b7,
7548:46	and then once they do get elected --n4037c4, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness --n403803 to do those things that they promised --n403826, you know, beforehand --n403841.
7548:53	and then once they do get elected --n4037c4, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness --n403803 to do those things that they promised --n403826, you know, beforehand --n403841.
7590:124	and they're the ones that, uh, you know, --n404908 really know what --n40491b's going on, have the experience and seen, you know, how politicians can, you know, screwup --n404976 or what ever.
7684:47	i don't know how long it takes --n4062ca whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes.
7864:64	and it's going --n402145 to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it.
8347:26	and they're good for about five years or four years
8419:45	well, have you any plans to, uh, maybe, uh, expand or move onward.
8447:73	so at least we know we're, it's not going --n402dc2 to fall in or something if it's built --n402ded.
8474:27	i mean it's not an eldorado house or anything like that,
8525:52	so, uh, what --n4009f5 happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts.
8532:96	but the thing, uh, also is that, you know, like if you want --n400da1 to go out like if you want --n400dc4 to go to a restaurant or something, then i have --n400df7 to moderate that because it's like i can't go --n400e2a eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars, um, you know, three times a week.
8633:50	so i won't have --n402d78 to, you know, rush a letter to him or something,
8657:3	or what's the specialty that you're looking for --n4033e6 --n4033ed.
8789:40	what about when you have breaks --n406023 like, um, christmas or between sessions.
8873:32	i don't know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make --n4009d1 or the smell of the wood
8873:53	i don't know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make --n4009d1 or the smell of the wood
8889:22	i make a lot of afghans or used --n4012eb to make a lot of them.
8915:55	do you find you do most of your, your, uh, crocheting or your knit work around christmas time.
8967:44	if we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected --n402ec9 some time or other, don't worry about it.
8974:13	instead of call waiting or call anything else.
9023:22	i think i had three or four seeds in each one of them,
9028:77	and i'm not sure when a good time to plant those --n40441d is --n404428, if they should be planted --n404447 early or later.
9072:53	well, i was just going --n405284 to say, it's a little over six or seven minutes.
9174:38	uh, what do you think individuals could do --n401ff3, or society could do --n40200e to alleviate this problem.
9346:23	well i remember last year, or the year before, uh, we had ice and snow, uh, uh,
9412:60	it's, it's not, not that it's just hot or dry,
9517:35	i guess we're supposed --n403e7a to say good-bye or something, and think about what
9568:46	i think i've actually seen a number of star treks, one way or another over the years. uh, although i never watched it regularly.
9650:26	and i usually make time in my day or my week, you know, --n402620 to watch those.
9855:62	they probably didn't have a t v until i got --n4063ce to be, you know, grade school or so.
9867:87	i, i, i ended up --n406785 watching a lot of these things on, you know, repeats in the afternoons or something.
10051:35	he just pitched his first, uh, exhibition game a day or so ago,
10197:18	he either hits home run or strike out.
10220:22	that, you know, may or may not happen.
10261:3	or i don't remember it if i have.
10372:8	the cat or the baby.
10475:23	it seems --n402e02 to mellow them or something.
10770:28	there was cartoon in cosmo about a year or two ago
10846:33	i wonder how truthful all of that was --n4011d3 or whether there was fiction.
10941:3	or was it kmart.
11323:99	that's what i do --n4045a8 with a lot of my daughter's things is i'll store her, you know, like her out dated or, out of, out of season clothes in them
11344:90	well, you know, it's cheaper than going and buying the kind at target that --n404d4a are all ready with the little design on them or whatever.
11453:3	or we didn't have time to do those bins --n4073cf or something
11453:41	or we didn't have time to do those bins --n4073cf or something
11516:62	this doctor discovers a drug that --n4007fb brings them back to the, the living, more or less,
11728:14	or, or,
11750:12	is it five or three.
11792:29	but, uh, i have some question, whether or not they will ever really get around to that.
11797:36	and, uh, i don't know whether that's bad or good,
11889:29	i'm not sure if it's kerosene or what that --n4015e0's dropping.
12033:60	i mean, what do you think we can, uh, i guess --n404446 as individuals or as a group, do --n40446d about, uh, air pollution..
12048:141	you ne-, yo-, ne-, i think you need a, a vehicle something like, uh, ralph nader, nader's raiders, or, where, uh, or, uh, uh, a a r p, which --n404b2f has a lot of members. uh, if you can get those types of groups.
12128:43	well, it just means if you don't pollute, right, or you pollute very little you don't have --n4067d5 to pay any tax
12129:3	or you just buy one of these things
12142:42	so you probably would have --n406f83 to build it right into the muffler or something.
12164:39	but if you was talking about something which --n40760d was more or less universal that, uh, busses and any kind of vehicle, had --n407658 to pay a pollution tax, uh, this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters,
12168:38	you should, uh, pursue that i think --n4078f8, or patent it, you know.
12197:12	the automobile regulatory agencies or something.
12200:93	other than that i'm not sure what, what individuals can do --n408251 other than like i said --n40826c get involved --n40827b through a group or an organization.
12265:3	or french donuts would have been good,
12272:28	i don't know if it's me or the water or the recipe i have --n40176b
12272:35	i don't know if it's me or the water or the recipe i have --n40176b
12275:5	humidity or something.
12441:3	or, uh, i mean, he left almost no alternative.
12584:63	when they be-, became a country --n40476e they more than, or, more or less decided they weren't going --n4047b1 to take it anymore,
12588:15	they could either fight or die.
12595:51	so i can't say whether that, that i'm pro israel or anti israel.
12606:3	or the arabs are going --n4053d8 to occupy the area
12611:119	and i think that's the problem the p l o has --n405612 is that when they, whenever one group of them decides that they're going --n405661 to negotiate, or they're going --n405684 to do something, they're going --n4056a7 to try --n4056b6 to make some peace --n4056cd, but, uh, the end result is that they, there so many factions of them and, uh, some more violent than others, some with a certain agenda different than the others, or they split,
12611:322	and i think that's the problem the p l o has --n405612 is that when they, whenever one group of them decides that they're going --n405661 to negotiate, or they're going --n405684 to do something, they're going --n4056a7 to try --n4056b6 to make some peace --n4056cd, but, uh, the end result is that they, there so many factions of them and, uh, some more violent than others, some with a certain agenda different than the others, or they split,
12804:45	i've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something,
12808:74	but, uh, but i, i'd just love --n40274d to be able --n402760 to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music
12868:26	like the, boston pops or, or anything.
13026:8	either alabama or hank williams, junior.
13033:62	and i never have figured out how he won, uh, entertainer of the year for about, three or four years in a row --n405eb5.
13047:33	i guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is, uh, probably eddy arnold.
13077:3	or they,
13254:5	friday or,
13311:70	if there was, if there was mandatory, you could choose the option of either a mandatory military service or voluntary,
13350:3	or go into the, the more depressed areas and help repair the houses.
13356:76	and, and a lot of the buildings in downtown areas that, that --n403448 either need demolishing, or need fixing up,
13362:27	uh, we've been doing this three or four minutes.
13389:122	i guess the, uh, biggest thing i f-, find --n4002b6 is the financial aspects, uh, particularly, the ability --n4002e9 of people to access, you know, your financial records or, for example your credit, uh, rating almost at will.
13410:53	--n40098f being a professional and, of course, you probably belong to one or more professional organizations,
13420:76	i get some of these things --n400c8e in the mail that i wonder, where in the world did they get my address --n400cd5 or where did they get my name --n400cf8 --n400cff.
13455:26	and you get, uh, a free trip or something along those lines.
13468:42	they just, you know, start --n4024ee going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers,
13517:3	or i'll,
13546:65	i actually during that period of time from, you know, usually from six o'clock or six thirty, whenever i get home --n404425, until eight or so, i will shut off the phone
13546:100	i actually during that period of time from, you know, usually from six o'clock or six thirty, whenever i get home --n404425, until eight or so, i will shut off the phone
13591:93	but now with this thing i'm participating in --n405a92, i kind of have --n405aad to answer it, because you never know if it's the switchboard or if it's, uh, you know, somebody calling that you really don't want --n405b30 to talk on the phone.
13614:19	and, uh, or i will just let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward to, uh, to the office.
13614:50	and, uh, or i will just let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward to, uh, to the office.
13633:32	isn't tigon, uh, part of g t e or vice versa or something like that.
13633:39	isn't tigon, uh, part of g t e or vice versa or something like that.
13665:45	i couldn't remember in tigon had purchased g t e --s phone mail services or if g t e had purchased tigon.
13741:30	uh, i have wondered why they allowed, or let, you know, both the father and mother go --n400ee4, uh,
13780:89	what, in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the potential changes over the, the next generation or so, i guess i anticipate, uh, an increasing equality, uh, greater presence of women in management roles
13811:92	and i could, you know, i could envision a society where that would happen --n402a77 and make an interesting, uh, uh, story or whatever.
13821:162	uh, i, i don't have a, other than, than a reading and, and male perspective on, on the ver-, on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not.
13830:43	vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or, or as a professional nanny, nanny as you put it, uh.
13834:72	maybe we'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of, say, --n40381a taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care --n403851.
13844:218	uh, i know that there are young people, characterized, i guess as being half my age, so that by definition that means, they're young. uh, that, in my work place, who --n403b6e are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably --n403ba1 would consider --n403bb0 paying a woman, uh, eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year --n403bf3 to take care of their child,
13844:222	uh, i know that there are young people, characterized, i guess as being half my age, so that by definition that means, they're young. uh, that, in my work place, who --n403b6e are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably --n403ba1 would consider --n403bb0 paying a woman, uh, eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year --n403bf3 to take care of their child,
13874:94	and then you might have more control over, uh, the, the morals that they would be taught --n404a62 --n404a69 rather than in like a classroom or a day care center.
13889:102	they have --n405001 to go with the, a single, uh, wh-, i mean a baby-sitter more, more or less.
13897:70	and you have --n40531d to pay that whether you're on vacation, you know, and taking care of the children or if the children are at home, at home, --n405398 sick.
13940:135	maybe, uh, the possibility of, of women, uh, who --n4064ac deliberately say, no, we'll let the man will take care of the children perhaps, in the event of a separation or whatever.
13977:40	i think they should either do that, or, or afford some time to the military, or, or --n400326 helping elderly people.
13977:75	i think they should either do that, or, or afford some time to the military, or, or --n400326 helping elderly people.
13989:14	and, or the military for a year or two, wouldn't be bad for,
13989:34	and, or the military for a year or two, wouldn't be bad for,
13998:38	the parents kind of pushed them to join, like the boy scouts or girl scouts
14012:39	you know, kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old --n401505 they fall out of that,
14114:23	normally i listen to c n n or headline news about an, hour a day,
14141:68	i would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves. um, since i don't necessarily agree with it or it tends --n4010db to be extraordinarily trite.
14162:28	radio seems --n401b16 to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need --n401b55 to get --n401b64 done.
14163:45	they're, maybe they're a little more efficient, or have more to do --n401ca2 over that same time frame.
14175:23	but i don't anymore, maybe once or twice a year.
14190:71	so, i guess we have the, the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not.
14193:179	well, i had heard a couple of people, you know, that i had talked to --n40265c about certain programs say that, you know, they had read other things besides what sixty minutes presented --n4026af and that they didn't present it nearly the same way as the, you know, news articles or whatever they had, they had already been familiar with --n402732.
14202:59	so, i don't, i don't know if you're familiar with him or not.
14253:43	i wondered if it would help you sometimes fill in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that other people, people like myself might not pick up on --n4041a3.
14262:12	at one time or another i've taken them all for a year.
14274:3	or like, does it give, um, i guess, little encapsulated reports and, and then a few big stories.
14292:63	um, and it's one of those that i can ei-, read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that i'm going --n404ffa to spend --n405009 in there --n405018.
14300:70	so, we decided --n405459 to try it because prior to that all we got --n40548c were things like glamour or sports illustrated.
14330:75	and it will, depending on what topic you called in --n406327 to hear about --n40633a whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update, it will give you, um, updated information.
14330:82	and it will, depending on what topic you called in --n406327 to hear about --n40633a whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update, it will give you, um, updated information.
14405:66	well, he could always get past, you know, he'd get past like six or seven tackles and just keep --n400d9a spinning around and get on into the end zone.
14407:35	so you couldn't really tell if it was just him or the team
14413:3	or is it, emmett smith.
14463:19	and then they won five or six in a row.
14509:69	but i remember --n4034c6 reading something --n4034d5 a few months ago about them signing somebody else on, or, or trying --n403518 to go after somebody or trade for somebody,
14509:94	but i remember --n4034c6 reading something --n4034d5 a few months ago about them signing somebody else on, or, or trying --n403518 to go after somebody or trade for somebody,
14511:27	but i heard on the radio this morning, or yesterday morning, that, uh, aikman's back in --n403790 practicing, doing real, real well.
14556:18	i've done that once or twice.
14626:8	thirty bucks or something.
14628:8	thirty, or thirty-two for really good tickets.
14639:25	but, um, they have about four or five different prices --n406cd1 now, that they're structuring it with --n406cf8,
14640:36	but obviously yeah, they're all going up, mumblex more or less is what it's going --n406e09 to do --n406e18.
14651:78	las-, time, last time i went to the cowboys game --n4073bd was during that, um, n f l strike, or the, when they had the scab team, teams in there --n407430,
14749:3	or ha-, has crime increased,
14829:63	i mean it's like, compared to, you know, compared to, weapons or stuff like that, i mean, you're spending nothing on, on crime in the country itself.
14875:209	but the guy at the very top, the one who --n404c65's, who --n404c7c's really making the millions and the millions is the one who --n404cb7 also many times is part of the power structure, uh, the, uh, and had the political uh, pull to keep things from, uh, keep the interest or the emphasis in some other direction, other than on the drug dealing,
15045:52	they're there when you need them --n401a34. you know, like in emergencies, or whatever.
15081:24	but right now, we're just more or less at american express, you know,
15207:70	well, it sounded like, i mean, this is like major long term commitment, like a year or six months,
15211:39	or, so you're looking at the peace corps or sabbatical maybe,
15212:3	or, you know, i don't know,
15229:24	i couldn't possibly commit a year or two of my life --n402218 to, to go --n40222f do something.
15277:52	after a certain amount of years of service, these employees can take off like six months or something, for some type of sabbatical or some, you know, some, something like that.
15277:75	after a certain amount of years of service, these employees can take off like six months or something, for some type of sabbatical or some, you know, some, something like that.
15301:13	and the peace corps or something like that is probably useful as, as that kind of a time.
15327:63	n-, and none of my really close friends in college went off --n404b8d to be missionaries or anything.
15335:19	yeah, or, or try --n40508c to make a living.
15364:14	oh, probably five or six.
15370:23	oh, i've done maybe four or five.
15459:47	i think i had some other, uh, like staying in shape or working out.
15579:66	i guess he was taking kevin costner to like the site where he was going --n40181c to be --n40182b or whatever.
15657:18	she cuts his foot off or something, you know.
15828:3	or is it.
15836:33	i don't know if it's been a deterrent or not, because we have, uh, just started --n400dad using it oh, for the past year or so.
15836:90	i don't know if it's been a deterrent or not, because we have, uh, just started --n400dad using it oh, for the past year or so.
16299:25	you have --n40262c to cut each thing or, you know, use the melon baller and stuff
16401:24	they're called --n404a0d moo goo leaves or something
16422:3	or just hand beat it.
16449:3	or after it's thickened i cook it for a good,
16455:3	or you can take it off and let it cool mumblex
16511:48	i mean, something she had collected --n406c92 out of woman's day or something.
16523:48	i think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or, or a regular beater
16581:3	or y-,
16673:3	or you just like it.
16752:140	and you don't, because it doesn't have words, you know, you don't feel like, there's anything you have --n402abc to remember --n402acb, you know, as far as --n402aee singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean --n402b25
16752:152	and you don't, because it doesn't have words, you know, you don't feel like, there's anything you have --n402abc to remember --n402acb, you know, as far as --n402aee singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean --n402b25
16803:35	i didn't play, play jazz flute or anything like that,
16895:11	for east texas or something.
17349:18	they do kind of follow or, are similar.
17505:18	that one about the gypsies, or that, hunger
17510:3	or, s-, uh,
17650:131	that's why i like --n406cbb to watch that masterpiece theatre on channel thirteen --n406ce2, because they'll take a classic and, and, uh, televise it you know, put it into a viewing format, more or less.
17758:53	i haven't decided whether, whether i want --n400cde to play yet or not
17818:24	i usually only go about a mile or two.
17825:58	it's, it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete, or on asphalt.
17829:56	suppose --n4024b9 to be much better if you find grass, uh, or, or dirt to jog on --n402510.
17859:69	but then i'll get tired of --n402ecb doing that, and maybe start --n402eea jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week.
17973:3	or do you watch, on t v.
17992:14	or, or richard simmons,
17994:3	or jane fonda.
18011:37	i don't know if he's still on any more or not,
18012:53	i don-, i don't know if i get e s p n or not.
18130:46	well, uh, pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries --n4000f7 buying stuff for the yard.
18182:39	i mean just, just scratching two or three inches was just a chore.
18197:49	um, where you live --n40189a is there a real high, uh, alkaline --n4018c5 or ash --n4018d4 content
18198:3	or,
18243:9	sprinkler systems or anything, uh, start --n4026dc to get real expensive because there's an awful lot of work that --n402717 has --n402722 to be done --n402735 chopping through the rock.
18245:67	and it, you know, no-,, not even, consider, considering a pool or anything like that,
18257:43	and, uh, i never really, messed with anything, uh, gardening or anything like that until now,
18302:57	i think it's, i think it only has about five or six more years to go --n403f84 because it's a, it's a really old bush,
18325:82	have you, have you, uh, done, um, done a lot of tree surgeon work on your trees or not.
18419:16	they have about two or three acres of land on lake front property, on a, on the side of a hill.
18501:69	but, um, the water usage, you know, they try --n408472 to limit --n408481, even though there's three or four streams that --n4084b0 flow into it,
18522:67	they don't, they don't even start --n408d7e growing until may, may or april, like after it's been raining for a few months.
18576:15	is it a two eighty-six or three eighty-six base machine.
18697:70	uh, there's no way that i could begin --n402c17 to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need --n402c66 --n402c6d to, to try --n402c84 to do my job --n402c9b without them.
18787:67	i don't know if it's, the, if they've done it citywide yet --n400cfe or not where they have the color coded, uh, bags and, uh, bins --n400d49.
18798:25	and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags.
18802:68	and the garbage men come by and, uh, collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty --n401275 or leave the ones if they're still in good shape.
18826:16	so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or so-, things like that goes in those boxes,
18826:23	so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or so-, things like that goes in those boxes,
19003:30	so, you know, if we have branches or something, they have --n405e8f to be cut --n405ea2 in four-foot lengths,
19079:83	and so i-, it --n407ae9's a real difficult choice whether we want styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills --n407b34 or, uh, china cups to use up our water --n407b6f.
19126:98	it's, it --n400838's hard to, to know anymore if it's a, a threat one way or another because, uh, it used --n4008bf to be s-, so, f-, much in the past that whatever the top said --n400916 the rest fell, you know, rank and file in behind it.
19130:45	and now that with gorbachev is introducing more, i guess, freedoms or expressions of freedom, it doesn't look as though, you know, everybody's following the same pattern.
19248:44	uh, but, of course, the people who --n403884 have challenged that or tried --n40389f to do, on-, have cor-, have not been world powers.
19252:3	or we're going --n403c0c to force you.
19257:14	or, or we can do something about it.
19261:74	whereas, you know, if the soviet union would have, who --n403d93 knows what taking over mongolia or, or something like that, who --n403dde is really, will we have been more just rhetoric, uh, rather than --n403e29 going in there officially or, you know, physically and try --n403e60 to, to remove them.
19261:164	whereas, you know, if the soviet union would have, who --n403d93 knows what taking over mongolia or, or something like that, who --n403dde is really, will we have been more just rhetoric, uh, rather than --n403e29 going in there officially or, you know, physically and try --n403e60 to, to remove them.
19269:60	and all of a sudden it was like somebody in the, in the red square or wherever said, okay,
19289:87	but i don't believe that he, in this first pass around, you know, --n404799 being the first one --n4047b4 to really turn things around or attempt --n4047d7 to is going --n4047ee to be allowed --n404801 to get away with it either.
19308:17	will there be a union or not.
19349:75	it --n405e66's easy to believe that they were probably more --n405e95 forced --n405ea0 into a pact than, uh, a volunteer or willingness to join.
19435:19	you know, some reason or other, you know, is, uh,
19469:30	was there nineteen of them or, or whatever,
19522:47	something that --n40978a's called --n409799 a, an economic force or what --n4097bc is called --n4097cb a military pact,
19604:48	i don't know if i would call it a collection of vietnam war stories or if i'd call it a collection of vietnam love stories.
19616:3	or,
19641:195	and, uh, the last, uh, i'm embarrassed --n40122a to say the last, you know, honest to gosh, cover to cover book that i read --n401285, i can not, right offhand, i tried --n4012b4 to read, uh, one of the, the michener, uh, lone star or the, the texas history book.
19669:3	or,
19728:70	where's some reference to this goddamn state of texas and the role that they played --n403093 either leading up to --n4030aa or in --n4030b9 the civil war --n4030cc.
19764:35	and they were cut --n404295 off at the pass --n4042ac more or less, at eagle pass.
19809:15	it sounds like iowa or something.
19822:3	or, god knows what.
19844:87	well, i've gone to the point where my husband, my husband travels, i get out like, you know, two or three books --n40559a.
19926:76	see, i had never really been into science fiction that much until, uh, somebody gave me mist of avalon probably about five or six years ago.
19930:37	i don't know if i'd call it science fiction or fantasy.
20016:38	well, see i, i am debating whether or not i want --n4089ac to go --n4089bb see the movie after --n4089d2 having read the book.
20080:60	currently, i think they are a little restrictive. uh, particularly for, uh, certain ethnic groups or from certain countries.
20095:80	i have nothing --n400ae7, of course, against, uh, the, uh, the south americans or, uh, or hispanics, in that sense,
20102:266	and, uh, so i think, uh, you know, the, uh, embargo we placed --n400f6f on the, uh, on the russian jews, although we mumblex of, uh, spent years and years, uh, --n400fe2 lobbying for their release and their ability to, um, immigrate from russia as soon as that occurred, we simply said that, uh, instead of the, uh, hundred and fifty thousand or so who --n40108d wanted --n401098 to immigrate to this country, we cut that by, uh, two thirds.
20118:86	you know, again, kind of having, uh, uh, within this century, come from a, uh, an immigrant family, or immigrant families on both sides.
20140:22	and i haven't taken the time or effort to learn what they are --n4021b2.
20160:209	i, i think if immigration was entirely unrestricted, uh, not only would, would the united states become over populated, well, more over populated awfully quickly, i think --n402d2b it, it would bring in a lot of, uh, people that --n402d76 are, run --n402d89 out of other countries or in trouble in, in other countries.
20229:101	it seems --n401157 to say, i'll tax them if you can't get enough money, instead of --n4011a6 trying --n4011b1 to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or, or, you know, get all of the waste out of the spending --n401224.
20229:120	it seems --n401157 to say, i'll tax them if you can't get enough money, instead of --n4011a6 trying --n4011b1 to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or, or, you know, get all of the waste out of the spending --n401224.
20379:3	or,
20446:21	so if you pay your rent or your house payment every two weeks, instead of once a month, you'll come out --n4050ba paying a, uh, one month extra every year.
20453:61	and it will, if have you a thirty year note, it will take like seven or plus years off of your note.
20456:39	my parents, uh, bought a home in san diego about four or five years ago,
20466:64	though the note is thirty years, she said it's going --n405693 be paid --n4056a2 off in twenty or twenty one years, or something like that.
20466:74	though the note is thirty years, she said it's going --n405693 be paid --n4056a2 off in twenty or twenty one years, or something like that.
20484:3	or, usually it doesn't.
20498:36	that's what we're looking at --n405e05, fifteen or maybe twenty.
20511:22	well, we just started two or three weeks ago.
20516:11	just two or three houses a week at the most.
20556:19	she was there for two or three years before we got married --n406a3e.
20716:3	or are you familiar with any of that.
20789:41	i don't want --n11e77 to be running down there every week, or whatever.
21034:54	we don't have cable to the point of, of the h b o or any of that stuff.
21046:3	or, i used --n401f70 to be really hooked on all my children,
21053:31	and i watched that for like, oh, ten or fifteen straight years,
21058:31	like at work, we'd have a t v or whatever.
21110:62	and as the world turns. i think as the world turns may, still on or not.
21263:38	so that was part of, i guess, his character building or whatever,
21314:41	but i think we wanted --n402a01 to see dede --n402a14 there or somebody like her.
21390:163	and that really made it a very interesting, uh, show to where you never really knew which, which one --n4044b4 was going --n4044c3 to show up. you know, whether it was going to, where they're going --n40450e to be real close --n404525 or whether they're just going --n404544 to be partners --n404557, you know
21398:48	and you always wonder, why they don't, you know, get together or whatever --n404abf.
21448:96	and and, well, of course, another one of their mistakes, i think --n405e2d, is they have a tendency --n405e50 to change characters, or to change the characters', uh, uh, personalities well, especially after they get married --n405eb3.
21511:48	but when he gets married --n407555 --n40755c, then you don't care any more or something like that,
21517:53	do you think that's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages secret --n40777e, or at least they keep it quiet --n4077a5.
21541:3	or at least, that's the way i look at it --n407d0f.
21643:3	or do they have a standing ball or a machine, or what.
21643:21	or do they have a standing ball or a machine, or what.
21643:30	or do they have a standing ball or a machine, or what.
21674:3	or do you go out.
21679:73	do you go, how about like for, uh, do you go for long vacations, like a week or something when they have school off --n40132b.
21685:12	in the summer or like in the easter time, like around now.
21765:67	uh, a very, uh, family thing, you know, made, like go --n402de5 skiing in vermont or something.
21800:33	it's like yeah, we never threw a football or something
22070:3	or does it stay in the bad neighborhoods.
22090:133	and once you've reached the, the river walk area, which --n401df1 is the tourist area, it's usually pretty safe during the day, if you're just kind of cautious and don't go down the back streets or alleys, and, um, you know, or alone.
22090:169	and once you've reached the, the river walk area, which --n401df1 is the tourist area, it's usually pretty safe during the day, if you're just kind of cautious and don't go down the back streets or alleys, and, um, you know, or alone.
22246:35	if i was going --n405804 to go out and drink or do something, i wouldn't do it in front of my child.
22280:3	or, you know, because it,
22322:41	but san antonio is considered --n407091 a nice clean city, believe it or not.
22355:3	or,
22388:17	so are you a freshwater or,
22409:25	and, uh, i have caught one or two small sharks
22444:46	and, you know, there's part, either as part of --n401157 or separate from --n40116a the, uh, bill fishing tournaments they usually have --n40119d
22482:15	it's a rhythm or something.
22485:34	i usually ended --n401aba snagging my, uh, fishing partners or the trees along the bank.
22501:3	or do you, do you eat what you fish --n401db8.
22529:66	oh, and occasionally we'd go out on a, you know, full day trip, you know, three or four other people and do either, again, bottom fishing or or for grouper
22529:104	oh, and occasionally we'd go out on a, you know, full day trip, you know, three or four other people and do either, again, bottom fishing or or for grouper
22536:3	or, i used to catch you know, i've caught a few worthwhile snappers, red snappers and gray snappers and so forth.
22591:3	or, you know, actually we were, uh, snapper fishing.
22630:104	of course what i used --n4047e5 to like --n4047f4 to do --n404803 though is go --n40481a snorkeling for scallops --n40482d in some of the bays, or uh, or oy-, for oysters.
22715:55	i've, i've caught them from, you know, three or four inches long up to, uh,
22719:47	i guess the largest one i ever caught --n4068d0 was probably eight or ten inches long,
22745:68	and the first thing i caught --n4071ae was a sand shark, which --n4071cd was probably a foot, and a half or, uh, two feet long,
22753:43	and then i was fi-, fished for another half hour or forty-five minutes, caught a few white fish and so forth,
22909:108	but then, you don't want --n12901 to go --n12910 do that when you don't have --n12933 to --n12942 because like, uh, you have --n12965 to give up your automobile or whatever.
22961:41	like, they could put it in one of their children's names or something you know.
23116:114	but, then i just, you know, bundle it up and put it on the front, you know, the front walk ev-, you know, every monday or every other monday, and have them pick that up,
23150:27	so every time we drink a coke or whatever --n402106 we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket.
23317:39	i guess the schools will get into it, too, sooner or later.
23449:67	and maybe instead of, of, uh, just kind of blowing it off just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do, maybe we should commit --n400f41 to spend a week,
23466:89	but the way our system, our court system works --n40172b, that guy is going --n401746 to have --n401755 to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time.
23477:3	or do they need a six person jury or, you know, those kinds of things
23477:24	or do they need a six person jury or, you know, those kinds of things
23481:3	or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try --n4020d4 to figure out what --n4020eb really happened. you know, a jury like that.
23488:144	you know, kind of mumblex off what we've been talking about --n402389 here, uh, i believe that our, we've become almost a litigious society where we, everyone is very quick --n4023f8 to sue or to threaten --n402413 to sue and that kind of stuff --n402436,
23497:32	and if you want --n402a78 to, your lawyer or your, your opponent need --n402aab to go --n402aba face this group of twenty-five or a judge mumblex like they have on t v
23497:87	and if you want --n402a78 to, your lawyer or your, your opponent need --n402aab to go --n402aba face this group of twenty-five or a judge mumblex like they have on t v
23504:17	and let either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case.
23504:30	and let either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case.
23535:51	there's a, a real name for that like the judean law, or something like that.
23676:18	you serve that yourself, or the, for a family.
23700:3	or do you have --n4013e0 to,
23901:7	sole or flounder is real good.
23944:12	s i n, or s e n
24015:54	i thought it was maybe like, you know, like five fifty or something.
24074:23	i didn't care about the program or anything else.
24108:42	i think if you're going into like, uh, law or medicine, a very particular, very specific field, even, even engineering, you can get, you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public, um, institution.
5978:22	like if you're stealing something or doing anything like that.
6751:6	unfair or something,
22365:23	so you wouldn't get confronted --n408097 or anything
23466:100	but the way our system, our court system works --n40172b, that guy is going --n401746 to have --n401755 to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time.
24200:82	the only field i'm not familiar with --n403988 really is education, which is required, --n4039af mumblex requires about four or five different fields really.
24421:57	and it, and if it's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it.
24504:102	i think your record should stand for itself. that, you know, if you've been tested --n400fb2 at other companies and you've always come up --n400fdd negative or whatever, then i don't see what the big deal is --n40101c that they have --n40102f to go to all the expense of --n401052 testing you over and over and over --n401075.
24557:27	. you know, as like a manager or supervisor thinks --n402853 or has suspicion --n402866 that someone is using drugs, do you think they should have the right to send them --n4028b9 to be tested --n4028cc.
24557:38	. you know, as like a manager or supervisor thinks --n402853 or has suspicion --n402866 that someone is using drugs, do you think they should have the right to send them --n4028b9 to be tested --n4028cc.
24609:54	well, does your r-, does your job require you to drive company equipment or to ap-, operate any type of machinery that --n403e0b might endanger someone.
24633:46	so i don't know if i wasn't drug tested --n4045ef based on that or because the man who --n404616 hired me didn't request the drug test, because i know that my company does drug testing on occasion.
24636:108	well, does your, the company say, for instance, does the company you worked for --n404857 bef-, before have the right --n404876 or do they have the ability --n404895 to say, hey, we've already drug tested her
24732:44	is, is, is it doing a good job or a bad job
24733:51	and you got --n40018f to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do.
24736:40	and are you talking about public schools being lower level, high school level or state school.
24757:57	even a bad school is a good school up here, where, if i lived in new york city or washington, d c, uh, i would seriously consider moving if i had a child.
24790:3	or you get counseling earlier
24807:72	or if you're going --n402381 to go the science route you can go to a target school that --n4023bc specializes in science or art.
24851:14	and, or maybe they're unemployed
24893:119	and plus for, for the type of student that --n404a69's going to that school, it's going --n404a94 to raise the level of the school because your parents are engineers or chemists.
24932:8	more taxes or better management of what they got --n405dfe.
24941:98	even though we've, uh, enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years, now we got eight percent, uh, unemployment when it used --n4063ef to be four or five --n40640a.
24964:43	and the only school you could go to --n406e6e was the baptist school or the catholic school
24979:39	see, i don't have any good ideas or, or anything that --n4072fa would contribute.
24983:30	the only reason i asked about secondary schools or, you know, advanced education --n4076bb is because down here, you know, going to the university of texas, the education i'm getting --n40771a i think --n40772d is kind of shoddy for a public school.
25105:3	or i don't know how much of the you know,
25119:14	or, or even have had the ability, you know, the chance to, to go to college or to, to to learn about,
25119:93	or, or even have had the ability, you know, the chance to, to go to college or to, to to learn about,
25236:42	and we were talking about something tot-, income tax or something.
25294:38	i haven't heard whether it's going --n400f2f to rain or not.
25318:34	i don't like it when it's too cool or too warm --n4018cb.
25323:87	um, one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety-nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high.
25332:63	i mean, any other time of year, that's not the case, because it could be very warm or very cold.
25522:55	i guess, the first time i played golf --n40213e has been probably about eight or ten years ago now, when i was in college --n402185.
25593:28	if you want --n403fa1 to play tennis, or racquetball,
25614:31	and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time.
25625:63	and never yet have i met anybody on the golf course that --n404a26 wouldn't allow me to join their twosome or threesome.
25661:186	but, uh, i'd like --n40571b to, uh, eventually i'd like --n405746 to work up, if, if my wife does get interested, and maybe get involved in a league in a, in a mixed, mixed doubles league, or something like that.
25665:34	uh, it runs from like five o'clock to seven thirty or eight o'clock, you know, because it doesn't get dark until nine thirty or ten.
25665:80	uh, it runs from like five o'clock to seven thirty or eight o'clock, you know, because it doesn't get dark until nine thirty or ten.
25750:101	i've, i've kind of formed the attitude that, you know, if i could just, if i could pick two or three shots out, uh, out of my game every time and put them together on one hole, then i do pretty good
25777:18	i never broke a club or anything,
25988:18	and interest is like eighteen or something.
26057:89	well, having, having been out of the credit game for some years now, i've gotten used to --n4045f3 either paying in cash or not getting it.
26108:23	circuit, circuit world or something.
26135:3	or you probably have something similar.
26310:51	and i would ima-, i would imagine that if i change or if i get another car, a new car, i will go with the taurus or something similar, uh, in that regard.
26310:107	and i would ima-, i would imagine that if i change or if i get another car, a new car, i will go with the taurus or something similar, uh, in that regard.
26384:65	you're talking when you think about price --n401dbc, it's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable honda or nissan or something along those lines.
26384:70	you're talking when you think about price --n401dbc, it's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable honda or nissan or something along those lines.
26390:57	well, ford's done a real good job --n4020f3 in the last, uh, say, ten years or at least the last five to te-, six years, so, of --n40216a really turning around their, um, quality, i think --n4021a1, um.
26418:129	and i would, i probably, if i had thought i, uh, wanted --n402a84 to pay the amount of money, i probably would have gone with, uh, uh, an accord or even a, a civic, or something comparable from nissan or toyota,
26418:156	and i would, i probably, if i had thought i, uh, wanted --n402a84 to pay the amount of money, i probably would have gone with, uh, uh, an accord or even a, a civic, or something comparable from nissan or toyota,
26418:172	and i would, i probably, if i had thought i, uh, wanted --n402a84 to pay the amount of money, i probably would have gone with, uh, uh, an accord or even a, a civic, or something comparable from nissan or toyota,
26447:34	i can drive for, you know, ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way.
26452:43	and i, i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start --n403b6a looking around again,
26474:25	in our parking lots, uh, two or three days ago i saw one of the new honda sports cars.
26479:17	it's the thirty-five or forty thousand dollar one, whatever it is --n40496a,
26538:60	we won't, we don't, we won't get the recorder or the, uh, system to shut us off, uh, tonight.
26625:3	or maybe offer them, you know, some sort of an incentive to do it. uh, you know college credit, you know, something, you know,
26738:99	like maybe if, if there was something they could do --n4030c8 in their own, own, in their own town or city, yeah, and not have --n403123 to pull up roots and, you know, go somewhere half way around the world, or something.
26738:170	like maybe if, if there was something they could do --n4030c8 in their own, own, in their own town or city, yeah, and not have --n403123 to pull up roots and, you know, go somewhere half way around the world, or something.
26767:3	or would they really, you know, make a contribution of some kind.
26779:50	and i don't know who --n403ce1's even proposing it, or, or how they plan on --n403d18 implementing it --n403d27, if they do.
26815:50	and you, you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something,
26845:102	and, i guess even back to kennedy, as a matter of fact, i guess kennedy may be the one that --n404f78 actually started the thing, or was, you know, really interested in things like that.
26907:20	did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels
26908:3	or,
27038:58	and if we did have a, a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken --n403a09 out of the schools or trying --n403a28 to teach them something while they were there.
27038:127	and if we did have a, a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken --n403a09 out of the schools or trying --n403a28 to teach them something while they were there.
27042:33	and you don't know if you were reaching them or not
27059:27	i don't know if was alcohol or something else that they were on --n404455
27241:140	i mean, i, i mean teachers are so afraid --n407551 now of even saying something, to students because they're going get, they're going --n4075a0 to get complaints or they're going --n4075c3 to get sued --n4075d6 or something.
27241:169	i mean, i, i mean teachers are so afraid --n407551 now of even saying something, to students because they're going get, they're going --n4075a0 to get complaints or they're going --n4075c3 to get sued --n4075d6 or something.
27268:38	we're going --n407e81 to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day
27318:27	and maybe they were a group of mennonites or something like that.
27363:3	or,
27384:38	i need --n400ade to, uh, either paper back over it or do something.
27403:11	well, more or less.
27413:32	and, and it supposedly textured it or did something to it
27434:39	and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars --n402265 --n40226c to paint it or something.
27516:17	this is sherwin williams paint or something
27531:45	and the blue, even so many years, two years --n404446 later or so it doesn't match, you know,
27733:3	or, uh,
27747:79	um, essentially i was one of the nerdy types in high school really which --n401138 meant that i, for one reason or another i didn't pay much attention to music,
27754:97	i think with, in a way one could talk about simon and garfunkel that way because they do tend, uh, --n40167d to have a dramatic or story approach to their music, uh, usually tend --n4016c0 to have some good or bad moral to it.
27754:140	i think with, in a way one could talk about simon and garfunkel that way because they do tend, uh, --n40167d to have a dramatic or story approach to their music, uh, usually tend --n4016c0 to have some good or bad moral to it.
27828:55	our generation was, uh, so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness --n404659 with, uh, things now with the music that --n404688's behinds them.
27846:151	uh, and my family now knows if they come into my study and, uh, i happen --n404e49 to have had a tough day at work and maybe i'm trying --n404e84 to get a project done, uh, at school, uh, and i'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to downtown they know --n404f0b to just stay away,
27863:29	and i have, uh, returned about every four or five years to --n4053d4 thinking that i would like --n4053ef to do something about it.
27895:52	they went through the, uh, parent thing where you've got --n406447 to practice or you're not going out --n40646e to play --n40647d thing,
27918:40	so we both have a secret background that --n407080 says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance, uh,
27951:28	and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job, unti-, well, unless,
27952:63	if you were educated you got, you know, you might teach for a year or two before you got married --n40073e.
27956:43	and if you really pushed it, you taught until you had kids or something you know,
27966:70	there was not, there's not supposed --n400bec to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have --n400c37 for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be --n400c82 on any given day --n400c99.
28003:40	i couldn't put in enough overtime that --n401b75 was necess-, or that, you know, things that --n401bb4 would come up at work, that --n401bd7 would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on saturdays as is, you know, as is needed --n401c5a, because my husband for a long time was out of the country also with, uh, with work, for like three months
28003:125	i couldn't put in enough overtime that --n401b75 was necess-, or that, you know, things that --n401bb4 would come up at work, that --n401bd7 would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on saturdays as is, you know, as is needed --n401c5a, because my husband for a long time was out of the country also with, uh, with work, for like three months
28003:139	i couldn't put in enough overtime that --n401b75 was necess-, or that, you know, things that --n401bb4 would come up at work, that --n401bd7 would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on saturdays as is, you know, as is needed --n401c5a, because my husband for a long time was out of the country also with, uh, with work, for like three months
28093:53	and and if it's not mom then, then dad or somebody's got --n4044ba to move in there and do the job, because the kids really need it.
28108:116	because if, if i had been allowed --n404d27 to work, you know, maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week, i might still be working basically full time or part time, if there was, if there had been some way --n404dd2 to work it out --n404de9,
28134:3	or my husband, if it's, you know, uh, when he's at home --n40583a, can take care of them.
28157:45	it's just convincing your husband that that's important, or that it's important enough for him to do it.
28170:152	because if he saw mom doing only that you know, all the time he was growing up --n40651a then it --n406529's hard to think of it in that, other, uh, that i should do it or just to think about doing it rather than having someone tell him to do it.
28255:99	they're going --n4086a3 to say to the kids you need --n4086c6 do this, because it needs --n4086e5 to be done --n4086f8 not because it's a woman's job or a man's job, but because it's dirty and it needs --n408757 to be clean.
28388:46	not only do i do p c type things like, uh, using lotus or word processors,
28470:146	they knew they were going --n402658 to have --n402667 to get a modem so that we could, mumblex in the decks machine so that we could, in my home, so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so.
28569:3	or i've got my p c configured --n4045ef to where i can use either printer. the one that --n404622's on the network or my own --n404645.
28569:79	or i've got my p c configured --n4045ef to where i can use either printer. the one that --n404622's on the network or my own --n404645.
28706:47	we find it hard to believe --n407193 --n40719a sometimes, or hard to understand --n4071c1 when, uh, we work for a computer company --n4071f0, and, uh,
28754:33	i mean even since i was like about two or three.
28790:3	or it's the geriatric crowd.
29005:67	i mean, uh, to add dependents is, is you know, maybe another dollar or something
29025:14	or, or a depe-,
29026:3	or a dependent of one.
29097:92	i do see a problem with graduating people that, that --n40058d can't read and are not, you know, productive in society or productive to themselves
29159:97	and, uh, i talked to a thirteen year old --n402ddc last night who --n402def's, uh, goes to, uh, one of the plano high schools or junior highs, i guess,
29161:24	she could either have taken tennis, or weight lifting
29361:19	they will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time.
29466:34	i don't know if it's h e b statewide or whatever,
29489:84	again --n404d8d not having, uh, lived through another war, i don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of --n404df4, or if that was a new concern with people.
29536:13	was it a wednesday or thursday.
29586:3	or do you have several.
29699:34	was, was the whole face --n400d4f done or just the numbers, and, and, like minute marks.
29727:27	and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth
29732:80	like it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or whatever --n401890,
29745:37	but i didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves or, or what,
29745:55	but i didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves or, or what,
29899:3	or i don't even want --n4052d5 to get into it in the first place.
29984:3	or do you go out an buy a, a kit, like for a bib or something like that.
29984:57	or do you go out an buy a, a kit, like for a bib or something like that.
30077:3	or,
30119:37	i'd sent them, you know, several hundred dollars, or whatever i felt i would spend --n40219a. and then use it then.
30174:99	uh, for example, i remember on one trip to france when i started --n4032b1 planning the trip --n4032c4, i think, uh, a dollar was worth nine or ten francs and just in a matter of a week or two the dollar fell against the franc, drastically.
30174:129	uh, for example, i remember on one trip to france when i started --n4032b1 planning the trip --n4032c4, i think, uh, a dollar was worth nine or ten francs and just in a matter of a week or two the dollar fell against the franc, drastically.
30178:66	and whe-, when i finally got over there --n403558, it had fallen, uh, two or three francs to the dollar.
30191:23	if it were, say sixty or seventy francs a night that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so, or maybe twenty dolls-,
30191:65	if it were, say sixty or seventy francs a night that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so, or maybe twenty dolls-,
30191:71	if it were, say sixty or seventy francs a night that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so, or maybe twenty dolls-,
30197:23	it would average out to thirty-five or forty dollars a night which --n403b7b is a reasonable rate.
30654:3	or people just change a, like, one word because they think it sounds better, or whatever.
30654:64	or people just change a, like, one word because they think it sounds better, or whatever.
30692:75	and so, you know, some day i would like --n4080d7 to get, even just like the video tell, or something like that, you know,
30714:19	and you'd have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time,
30714:23	and you'd have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time,
30767:3	or,
30787:64	and, uh, and it's a huge eagle, you know, wing span of twenty feet or something like that.
30792:69	and i mean, i know they, there must have used, been computers or something for animation this day,
30829:71	this is supposed --n401997 to be the, the guy that --n4019c6's, uh, replaces bruce lee or whatever or, or the next chuck norris type of guy.
30829:87	this is supposed --n401997 to be the, the guy that --n4019c6's, uh, replaces bruce lee or whatever or, or the next chuck norris type of guy.
30849:60	or, and all of them, i guess, could be in that fashion, or category.
30872:70	it was really, i mean the hollywood really must think there's some real dummies out there or something.
30887:42	you know they're usually not, not that great or didn't do that great anyway.
30997:16	i read about one or two thick novels like that a year. you know,
31107:58	they probably do the story of someone who --n406dad was shot --n406dbc down early in the war or something and how he survived --n406def or, or about, or about those two newsmen or whatever that --n406e36 got captured --n406e45.
31107:104	they probably do the story of someone who --n406dad was shot --n406dbc down early in the war or something and how he survived --n406def or, or about, or about those two newsmen or whatever that --n406e36 got captured --n406e45.
31107:121	they probably do the story of someone who --n406dad was shot --n406dbc down early in the war or something and how he survived --n406def or, or about, or about those two newsmen or whatever that --n406e36 got captured --n406e45.
31165:126	but, uh, --n4003d4 being one of these late in life mothers, i've listened to everybody else's, you know, complaints as to wha-, what --n400443's the matter with either their kids or the school system.
31180:140	and, uh, you know, i, i've, in hindsight, seen some things that i wished that, you know, i had done something about --n40084f that --n40085a was, you know, within my power or, uh, you know, wish that in some ways we, as parents, had more control over what --n4008d9's happening up there, you know, type thing.
31185:89	uh, well, just over the years there were situations that, uh, uh, --n400c57 came up that i didn't think --n400c7e were fair or handled --n400c95 correctly
31186:3	or the teachers didn't seem --n400de7 to be teaching anything.
31200:26	it --n40149a was told --n4014a9 to me or suggested --n4014c0 to me, uh, that to work as a teacher in the public school systems in the state of texas, and i think it's similar in, in many other states, if you have a degree in a technical field you do not need a teaching certificate because there is such a shortage of, uh, people --n4015cb to teach math and sciences.
31205:60	and there's always going --n401a1c to be, you know, somebody having a need for a math or science teacher.
31223:100	in fact, i think that's, that's one of the big problems today is the, the way the kids behave or act --n402167 and, and the way they are sometimes disinterested in what --n40219e's going on in the class and disruptive --n4021c5.
31268:79	the people that --n403888 took, you know, the lower level courses, i sometimes wondered, you know, are they really even educatable or trainable
31271:122	are the rest of us who --n403a8e went for the big bucks, you know, staying out of, you know, where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated --n403af9 to spend some time --n403b10 teaching or something with these kids --n403b2f.
31292:58	and i keep --n404471 thinking, you know, gifted is, is einstein or, you know, uh, musical prodigies.
31336:20	can they convey the data verbally or in writing.
31347:55	well, my stepson, you know, i, he went into the navy or air force.
31385:27	otherwise, he might have been driving trucks or framing houses, you know, from here to eternity.
31405:84	maybe adult literacy. maybe, you know, composition writing. maybe, you know, uh, volunteering, you know, on a tutor line or though the, even through the elementary schools for help with homework
31406:3	or, the other part of me says, is god, i've had enough kids.
31471:9	checked out or whatever.
31481:128	for example, that one, uh, positive would not be, uh, accepted --n401b04 as an automatic, um, reason for whatever they might be going, --n401b43 to do --n401b52 if they found a positive, uh, dismissal or treatment or whatever, but that, that what it would do --n401bbd is it would trigger, perhaps, uh, one or two more stages where further tests could be ta-, uh, done --n401c24 --n401c2b.
31481:132	for example, that one, uh, positive would not be, uh, accepted --n401b04 as an automatic, um, reason for whatever they might be going, --n401b43 to do --n401b52 if they found a positive, uh, dismissal or treatment or whatever, but that, that what it would do --n401bbd is it would trigger, perhaps, uh, one or two more stages where further tests could be ta-, uh, done --n401c24 --n401c2b.
31481:207	for example, that one, uh, positive would not be, uh, accepted --n401b04 as an automatic, um, reason for whatever they might be going, --n401b43 to do --n401b52 if they found a positive, uh, dismissal or treatment or whatever, but that, that what it would do --n401bbd is it would trigger, perhaps, uh, one or two more stages where further tests could be ta-, uh, done --n401c24 --n401c2b.
31488:53	because, um, there are, there must be people like you, or in other circumstances, that --n401fb1 could come up with, with, uh, false positives for certain kind of drugs.
31499:38	but, um, in many, many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs, it's not even going --n40258f to effect anybody but his, uh, you know, himself and his own family, perhaps, um, depending on the kind of drug he might be on --n402616.
31508:145	i guess i, i, uh, i would not want --n402ace to have anyone in my family, uh, victimized --n402afd by someone who, you know, a, a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that, who, um, you know, --n402b80 hadn't been tested --n402b97.
31508:154	i guess i, i, uh, i would not want --n402ace to have anyone in my family, uh, victimized --n402afd by someone who, you know, a, a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that, who, um, you know, --n402b80 hadn't been tested --n402b97.
31526:59	i mean, you don't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not,
31549:3	or at least it seems that way.
31580:134	i mean, he, he puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly --n404911 thinking that, you know, he, he's not sure if he's going --n404958 try --n404963 to commit suicide or not.
31604:185	well, the limits, uh, uh, would, i think --n4054b3, have --n4054c2 to do with what i'd alluded to --n4054e9 before, that there needs --n405508 to be a further, um, that, that one positive on a drug test, would not constitute, uh, dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might, uh, have --n4055ab set up for those who --n4055c6 genuinely have a problem.
31604:204	well, the limits, uh, uh, would, i think --n4054b3, have --n4054c2 to do with what i'd alluded to --n4054e9 before, that there needs --n405508 to be a further, um, that, that one positive on a drug test, would not constitute, uh, dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might, uh, have --n4055ab set up for those who --n4055c6 genuinely have a problem.
31632:37	and people who --n406033 are on medication, for example, or, um, even people who --n406072 might be of the gay community,
31673:84	well, there's, yeah, there, there's going --n407140 to be some measure of incentive, uh, reward or whatever,
31782:11	in cold frames or whatever the,
31957:38	is that the stuff that koala bears eat --n4042c2 in australia or something.
31963:30	i guess they're stoned on the stuff or something.
32093:23	so what i'm planting --n40799f or actually transplanting --n4079b2 is a tree that --n4079c9's, or trees that --n4079e4 are already leafed out.
32096:57	i guess they, they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall, all.
32137:3	or is it,
32252:29	and especially when the weather's not too hot or, not raining or whatever --n400b66,
32252:38	and especially when the weather's not too hot or, not raining or whatever --n400b66,
32274:94	there's not enough room to plant. some of those things like, uh, you know, the things that --n40102c vine like, uh, cucumbers, or, uh, squash or something, like that. plant one of those
32274:106	there's not enough room to plant. some of those things like, uh, you know, the things that --n40102c vine like, uh, cucumbers, or, uh, squash or something, like that. plant one of those
32481:28	and i screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something.
32481:38	and i screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something.
32577:93	next year i was planting some broccoli and, and some of those, they're called --n405996 cabbage, --n4059a5 cabbage loppers, or whatever.
32743:17	and it weighs twenty pounds or, something like that.
32859:72	and they lasted from, you know, about when you harvest them --n4099a0 about a month from now or so, or six weeks, from now, until, until like october,
32859:78	and they lasted from, you know, about when you harvest them --n4099a0 about a month from now or so, or six weeks, from now, until, until like october,
33020:29	i don't know unless it, labor intensive or something.
33076:56	well, um, i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal --n4008de or a informal --n4008f1 dinner party.
33145:35	but, um, you know, if you have nails or anything you can plan on those being shot.
33160:33	you know, we'd just have crawfish and beer or something
33161:98	but, um, if it was more formal like if i was, you know, working environment then i would probably, um, sh-, shell'em or at least disconnect them from the head.
33177:27	and usually you use those like for frying or --n402e3b to put --n402e4a in salads or to um you know make a sauce with --n402e7d or something like that
33177:52	and usually you use those like for frying or --n402e3b to put --n402e4a in salads or to um you know make a sauce with --n402e7d or something like that
33177:82	and usually you use those like for frying or --n402e3b to put --n402e4a in salads or to um you know make a sauce with --n402e7d or something like that
33245:36	we we tried --n40405e to be fancier or more courses than the other
33250:3	or
33255:107	and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be ethnic food or um sometimes it would be um oh oh i don't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh elegant theme or you know
33255:117	and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be ethnic food or um sometimes it would be um oh oh i don't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh elegant theme or you know
33262:29	and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something
33291:11	make hot dogs or some potato chips
33373:89	when you use corn starch in in gravy --n4063fa like you know when you have um chinese food --n406425 that kind of a gravy or a sauce that --n406450 comes with a lot of that
33521:77	when you go over there --n400b13 does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged --n400b46, either at the dallas location or the spring creek --n400b75, in terms of, there's so much, it's so much of a weight orientation, weight lifting, et cetera.
33545:3	or,
33590:22	and as we were jumping around or doing something i just jumped up and came right down on it.
33778:41	do you like --n4056b6 to exercise because you want --n4056d1 to or because you have --n4056f0 to.
33856:25	i try --n406a36 to go real late or real early before they get there.
33860:65	but, you know, sometime when i ask --n406bf8, i just feel like, boy, am i stupid or what.
33930:3	or,
34018:36	uh, my gun hasn't been shot --n400e3f in a year or two.
34041:43	the criminals that --n40170c are going --n40171b to get their guns one way or the other.
34046:191	i think, you know, one of the things that, that, that --n4018d7 needs --n4018e2 to happen is, uh, to, to stop the impulse buyer from, uh, --n40193d buying it quickly and, and, uh, maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it.
34082:72	i do too. uh, because it --n402857 doesn't make any difference, uh, uh, whether it's a pistol or a shotgun, i suppose --n4028b6.
34104:22	you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get.
34131:3	or you.
34190:45	and, uh, this one guy decided --n4053ad to play, uh, lonesome cowboy or something.
34204:16	it was about four or five years ago.
34214:14	and, or do you believe that you ought --n405d1b to be able --n405d2e to sell your system, uh, because you own it.
34532:55	do you take her, or do you go to a lot of comedy movies or to,
34573:88	i mean, there, there were times when he was, like, he'd be running with a gun or whatever --n40372b.
34583:89	because, i mean, everybody grows up --n403af0 looking at these cop movies and trying --n403b13 to, you know, to imitate them or whatever.
34601:91	and i guess that i thought --n4040a5 was a real good acting and writing job both --n4040d0, you know, because i think, or directing job.
35001:135	i, i have a hard time --n40122c sticking with something like, like on t v, because, it, like, it gets real aggravating if you miss it, for a week or two.
35107:25	you have --n4034d2 to shut your eyes or not listen or something, because those drive you crazy, if you're, if you're in the room.
35107:32	you have --n4034d2 to shut your eyes or not listen or something, because those drive you crazy, if you're, if you're in the room.
35122:86	and, you know, their demographic studies that they do --n403bbe that --n403bc9 show, you know, that everybody's i q has dropped dramatically or something.
35159:3	or there was some other,
35369:98	well, we've, uh, we've, we've test driven the oldsmobile delta eighty-eight and a cutlass supreme and a used cadillac, about three or four years old because, uh, i get married --n400170 in a couple of weeks
35393:113	that, uh, in addition to getting a new car there, they can get you a car that --n400783's new but --n400796 it's been, uh, a demonstrator model for two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you --n400805 for a new car.
35439:3	or they used,
35451:3	or,
35483:3	or do i look for a used car that --n401f3f's maybe two, three years old that but that --n401f7a's, you know, low mileage and in good shape.
35489:14	or, or is something wrong with it
35503:30	but if you've narrowed it down to one or two you can have the car, uh, uh, checked --n402891 at, uh, an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong, because they don't have any financial interest in it.
35519:24	oh, i'm thinking around twenty or twenty-five dollars.
35550:65	well, what you can do --n4037fd is take your car payment and put it in the bank for three or four years
35654:67	but, you know, that's a sign that i'm going --n40556f to have --n40557e to do something sooner or later.
35663:3	or,
35761:57	he said, you're going --n40768f to get a car that --n4076aa's got flood damage or hail damage.
35840:44	but, uh, uh, i don't know if it's their proposal or one that --n4000f0's being seriously kicked --n400107 around.
36021:57	and, and there's probably, there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy.
36071:7	educational or vocational training or something.
36071:13	educational or vocational training or something.
36223:17	picking up the garbage or educating our kids.
36344:3	or,
36407:3	or do you go to groups
36408:3	or,
36414:33	we used --n401277 to try and belong to clubs or the y, stuff like that,
36472:25	but the last little while, for one reason or another, we haven't been real consistent.
36524:73	and they said that they had ex-, that the one they had exercised with --n403e99 was three or four times easier.
36559:86	but there's a lot of different things you can do --n404c1d that --n404c28 are enjoyable that you don't have --n404c4b to strain yourself or sweat or be real sore afterwards --n404c7a.
36559:91	but there's a lot of different things you can do --n404c1d that --n404c28 are enjoyable that you don't have --n404c4b to strain yourself or sweat or be real sore afterwards --n404c7a.
36572:30	i think we've talked about six minutes or so.
36619:25	they don't have like a shower room or anything,
36703:52	other than, you know, taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something and, and sweeping it out everyday, it --n40255a's really hard to, to keep the sand and dirt out of it.
36809:26	and i could really talk about like gardening or something,
36845:14	or, or get,
36918:68	i mean some, i think some people that --n4079dc had fairly sturdy, um, vehicles or whatever if they had like a winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water, i think they stayed.
36918:93	i mean some, i think some people that --n4079dc had fairly sturdy, um, vehicles or whatever if they had like a winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water, i think they stayed.
36923:15	it was either that or their truck was going --n407d14 to go --n407d23 floating downstream.
36973:48	and the russian people are all realizing that the communist system does not work to their satisfaction or their way of surviving in this world,
36975:25	if they can get the army, or the military to sway to their side, i think that, uh, --n400c67 it will be on the way out eventually.
37011:85	but gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that, he's moving towards a two to three party system of government that, nor eliminating or diminishing the communist power,
37097:119	but i, i just don't think they have the resources, if you were --n4050c4 to compare, uh, the americans to the soviets as far as home computers --n405107 are concerned --n405116 or fact machines, fax machines and cellular phones, and state of the art equipment that we are so used to --n405175.
37120:32	when you've lost something or, or uh, uh, don't have what other people have --n405b67 --n405b6e that's when you tend --n405b89 to realize, you know, what --n405bac's out there and what, you know, what you have --n405be3 and what you don't have --n405c02 --n405c09.
37134:69	the only yes i could go to --n4060ea is if uh, a renegade crew decides --n406111 to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect to, to a nuclear exchange,
37134:78	the only yes i could go to --n4060ea is if uh, a renegade crew decides --n406111 to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect to, to a nuclear exchange,
37152:54	well i wondered if i was going --n40002e to get --n40003d to talk to a male or a female on this type.
37171:24	they may be going to school, or may have elderly parents, or you know all sorts of other things.
37171:39	they may be going to school, or may have elderly parents, or you know all sorts of other things.
37241:60	but when i run into people that, you know, --n401e51 just have recently had babies or have very young children and are working full time --n401e94, i, there's almost a, uh, friction between us.
37325:3	or are we going --n403b07 to keep --n403b16 having --n403b21 to try --n403b30 to juggle all of this.
37432:107	eve-, every once in a while, i will keep in, in touch, with maybe, like who --n400bb9's in the top five of hitting, or something like that
37433:51	but i don't get into, you know, how many errors somebody has --n400d88 or things like that.
37457:58	they don't have the offense to, uh, to get out, or to have the, the more runs --n4016ff,
37596:26	do you still keep up with them, or someth-,
37644:8	and whether or not they can fix that or not is going --n40821e to be an interesting question.
37644:26	and whether or not they can fix that or not is going --n40821e to be an interesting question.
37711:31	when it --n409dff starts --n409e0a costing you fifty or a hundred dollars to go to a game --n409e45
37717:41	say you go to a rock concert, or, or even a performance, a, an opera or the symphony or something, uh,
37717:75	say you go to a rock concert, or, or even a performance, a, an opera or the symphony or something, uh,
37717:82	say you go to a rock concert, or, or even a performance, a, an opera or the symphony or something, uh,
37737:24	but what, somehow or another they, attract, uh, so many people from, som-,
37749:72	we're going --n400038 to talk about the public school system, what --n400063's wrong with it, an, or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do --n4000b6 about it, what --n4000cd should be done --n4000e0 about it.
37770:39	but i wouldn't want --n4008bf to go --n4008ce teach high school or junior high,
37804:22	now do you have little kids, or what.
37831:3	or they going --n401dfc be taught --n401e0b something,
37846:19	not if you can read or write, or do, or un-, understand some science.
37846:40	not if you can read or write, or do, or un-, understand some science.
37930:95	i mean, i'd, i'd be afraid --n404eb2 to be in school, i mean --n404ed5 b-, teaching, or even being a student
37977:39	their friends that --n406791 are dealing drugs, or, or your parents.
38195:38	so, uh, does your husband ever use, uh, a laptop or a notebook.
38197:3	or,
38345:16	you probably use mumblex or something like that, for your, uh, data entry stuff that you're, talking about --n40589a.
38356:46	do you get, do you work at home all the time or just,
38450:57	they just, um, they just send me everything and pick it up courier or whatever,
38578:3	or should we stay on the topic of books.
38610:3	or do you, have you read any good novels lately.
38666:43	and then i, i get distracted --n4036f5, and, or have --n403710 to start on another one,
38800:88	you know, it's, it --n406615's so easy to get caught --n406638 up on reading just for your work, or, you know, self improvement,
38859:67	i would love --n400805 to do crafts and stuff if i just had the time to do it --n40084c or if i had the space.
38905:54	mostly just stuff that i can, you know, use --n4015c7 right around the house or give --n4015e6 away as gifts.
38938:34	and i always have --n4020af to either take it out or have my picture slightly off centered or, or something.
38938:63	and i always have --n4020af to either take it out or have my picture slightly off centered or, or something.
39001:11	more like embroidery or something.
39050:31	and then in the summer i'll plant petunias, or something that --n404628's colorful
39104:53	have you tried any, --n4054f8 growing any, um, like fruits and vegetables or anything.
39108:72	i never have tried that, just because i don't have that much space on this little porch --n40573f here in this apartment or this little balcony.
39189:3	or get into a house with a little more space.
39214:52	if we were going --n407b0e to get anything now it would definitely be a cat, or even a bird or a fish tank or something, you know. something small
39214:63	if we were going --n407b0e to get anything now it would definitely be a cat, or even a bird or a fish tank or something, you know. something small
39214:72	if we were going --n407b0e to get anything now it would definitely be a cat, or even a bird or a fish tank or something, you know. something small
39225:68	because, you kind of, even, even a cat, you never know when they might bite or scratch or something --n407e9f.
39225:73	because, you kind of, even, even a cat, you never know when they might bite or scratch or something --n407e9f.
39230:62	but with little ones, i'd be kind of scared, --n4080ea to get anything that --n408101 has teeth or claws.
39237:20	and if i was a cat or dog, i'd respond probably by --n408409 biting or something.
39237:49	and if i was a cat or dog, i'd respond probably by --n408409 biting or something.
39593:60	we might try --n404d58 to, to, um, to grill some flounder or salmon steaks.
39615:30	do you, do you garden or not.
39729:68	but usually if i'm, if i'm, if i take a day off or on the weekend especially, i try --n40718f to cook, real, real food.
39760:67	and we have a share alike column in the paper, where people, you know, write in and share recipes or write in and say i'm looking for this recipe --n407815,
39859:31	so, they made it to the sweet sixteen, once or twice, in their history,
40006:3	or,
40150:31	and they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back, you know,
40181:76	but i, i guess the headlines said something about him, you know, that the mavericks released him or something,
40239:3	or they're not brothers,
40240:63	but i mean there's two guys named johnson --n4078c5 on their team that --n4078dc are really good or doing good or something,
40240:71	but i mean there's two guys named johnson --n4078c5 on their team that --n4078dc are really good or doing good or something,
40409:3	or you wouldn't have him there, i know --n401a47,
40465:3	or do you get --n40261e to stay home with them.
40469:3	or she's, i guess,
40534:23	did you have them in a center or something last summer.
40595:16	it took us two or three different people --n404e59 to find,
40609:42	there's an association --n4051c3 here in town of professional home, care providers or something like that.
40698:3	or, you know.
41140:3	or,
41150:3	or did you have hotel rooms,
41151:3	or, how did you do it --n402cb6.
41234:8	a house or something.
41246:82	see, that would be great because then you could spend so much more time --n404555 together, than if you all were in your own hotels or something.
41253:91	and then, every time you wanted --n4046fb to go --n40470a eat with somebody --n40471d, you'd probably have --n404738 to go to out, --n404753 eat or something.
41307:9	and three or four or five families can stay in those cabins because they have, you know, just the single bunk beds and stuff.
41307:13	and three or four or five families can stay in those cabins because they have, you know, just the single bunk beds and stuff.
41341:120	but, i didn't think that was as good. because, it was like, you know, you couldn't really talk and stuff, like you could when, you were at the lake, or somewhere, you know, where you were out.
41367:3	or did the people that --n40670f had that reunion have --n406726 to draw a line.
41388:23	i think there was four or five different people, that --n406c71 would call, you know, some of them, if they didn't have their addresses and all on them,
41402:51	and then, when they, when they talked to us --n407143 or when they sent us the letter --n407166, it, uh, you know, to get the information and all, it asked, you know, will you be willing --n4071d5 to bring
41426:22	now if there was a sickness or something like that, i mean, you know, you're not going --n4079ba to lose that many.
41511:66	and they charged us, i think it was like, it was like --n408e7c five or six dollars, i can't remember exactly, you know, that we paid --n408ec7 for the book to be printed --n408ee6.
41614:3	or, i, i teach training classes,
41615:46	and so when i'm teaching a class --n400cba, obviously i wear a suit or dress,
41626:63	and, and when it's really cold --n401055 i'm more likely --n40106c to wear jeans or pants or sweaters, or that type of thing.
41626:67	and, and when it's really cold --n401055 i'm more likely --n40106c to wear jeans or pants or sweaters, or that type of thing.
41626:73	and, and when it's really cold --n401055 i'm more likely --n40106c to wear jeans or pants or sweaters, or that type of thing.
41631:82	and then, you know, obviously when i'm doing anything that i'm in front of people --n4012a7, or, or making presentations, teaching, whatever --n4012d6. i'm going --n4012ed to dress up more.
41676:47	and then there are some that --n4023e8 may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee.
41706:73	because maybe they, those are not the clothes that --n402e29 are the most, uh, appealing to you, or the most, uh, complimentary to you.
41788:38	so i was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or manish,
41798:95	and, uh, and i find even, even at home here now, i, i will wear blue jeans or i'll wear shorts and what have you --n4050f6, uh, and be very comfortable
41834:48	and they don't allow, uh, any sweat, any sweat shirts or t shirts that --n40614c might have vulgar, or, you know, anything like that on it,
41834:74	and they don't allow, uh, any sweat, any sweat shirts or t shirts that --n40614c might have vulgar, or, you know, anything like that on it,
41858:18	and they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and, you know, no variation,
41858:22	and they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and, you know, no variation,
41873:48	they all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or sla-, or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie.
42077:97	but gosh, you know, we're keeping, you know we're, we're keeping these men in prison for fifteen or twenty years on death row, and not doing anything with them,
42157:3	or was it not.
42190:40	men --n405b4c breaking in, uh, to houses and taking, or a man, they, they think it's the same person, taking, uh, little girls right straight out of their beds at night. and, ku-, you know, breaking in, obviously watching them in the house, because they're breaking into the right window, you know, the little girl's bedroom. and taking them out, putting them in a car and driving them out and taking them out and molesting them and then bringing them back and throwing them back in their own front yards.
42211:60	i think there's been, i think there's been like six or seven of them, over the last like probably eight or nine months.
42211:89	i think there's been, i think there's been like six or seven of them, over the last like probably eight or nine months.
42426:34	you know, because then they'll serve fifteen or twenty, so. which --n40a40f is really,
42508:50	if, if you're going --n4009dc to hunt with it, or if you're going --n400a0b to do sport shooting you can wait a week.
42553:48	i don't think they're going --n401969 to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there's a check --n4019c0,
42554:55	i think they're going --n401aee to go out and find it someway, individual sale or something like that.
42565:107	like i say, i don't think the guy who --n401e8f's going --n401e9e to rob a seven eleven, is going --n401ec5 to rob a seven eleven whether he has a gun or a knife, baseball bat, or, you know, whatever,
42565:123	like i say, i don't think the guy who --n401e8f's going --n401e9e to rob a seven eleven, is going --n401ec5 to rob a seven eleven whether he has a gun or a knife, baseball bat, or, you know, whatever,
42631:3	or even even the um the little um toy guns look real.
42645:77	i mean, there are a lot of kids who when they're ten --n4035c1 --n4035c8 look like they're twelve, or fourteen or, and, and, especially some of the minority children. whether, you know a racist or not,
42645:153	i mean, there are a lot of kids who when they're ten --n4035c1 --n4035c8 look like they're twelve, or fourteen or, and, and, especially some of the minority children. whether, you know a racist or not,
42766:91	because i started --n405a07 shooting, my dad started --n405a22 letting me shoot like a little air b b gun, when i was probably five or six years old --n405a79.
42792:80	if you want, if you want --n4062ee to go --n4062fd deer hunting and your birthday's after nineteen something, fifty-five or something, then you have --n406348 to attend one of these hunter safety courses
42799:3	or you can't get a deer license.
42841:20	i took the clip out, or whatever
42865:49	she'll even tell her friends, don't ever, touch my daddy's guns or something like that.
42880:35	and he'll tell how he's doing it --n407b80 or, you know, show her the insides or stuff like that.
42880:60	and he'll tell how he's doing it --n407b80 or, you know, show her the insides or stuff like that.
42958:70	but, boy if someone did break in, i don't, i don't know that i could or would even grab it.
43013:47	and, and most people that --n40a3ea, uh, break in or whatever, go to houses without the dogs, luckily.
43156:41	basically, i like --n401bc6 to mow the lawn, believe it or not,
43216:36	and we got rid --n4033f6 of them, believe it or not, with smoke bombs, which --n403435 is just about impossible to do --n40345c,
43253:23	and he doesn't gripe about it or anything,
43262:3	or it'll, it'll tear up a nice tiller.
43671:48	it --n405e67's hard to find movies that --n405e8a aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore.
43672:51	and i'm just, i guess i'm just middle america or something.
43673:83	i just go --n4060bb to be entertained --n4060ce and and not really interested in some of the, like the terminator or some of the schwarzenegger stuff.
43688:15	freddy's revenge part twenty-five or whatever.
43724:70	if i ever get the hankering --n406d1a to see something, i've got, i don't know, maybe about thirty or forty movies
43928:23	it's kind of like waterfront property or something if you're, you know, if you're two miles away from water.
43991:16	are you talking, outside or inside.
44014:74	it's more trim because it has some of the old asbestos shingles, on the back and there's some sort of stone or something in the front
44026:3	or else it will flake.
44107:3	or they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever they,
44107:26	or they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever they,
44109:63	so it looked as if it had been painted --n403467, correctly with, you know, uh, an enamel or something,
44113:29	but, um, it had not, either that or it had not been prepared --n4035c6 underneath
44114:15	and it was greasy or something,
44159:76	i think that if it wasn't for the united states government matching that the g-, the drug, uh, cartels or whatever would control most the central and latin america.
44192:3	or, you know, why, why, why intervene in another country's, you know, problems --n401728 and things like that.
44211:98	even if a country chooses a government that --n402064's not, you know, exactly the kind of government that we have --n4020a3, you know or, or as in complete opposition to it, at least it's their choice, as long, as long it's one that --n40213a's, that, that --n40215d makes since, so to speak, you know,
44235:14	or, or government aids and stuff.
44249:62	i'm, i'm really wondering whether that's going --n403108 it settle down or not,
44262:3	or do you think that we are to the degree that we are causing.
44383:3	or why do they not, you know, stand up, so to speak, for their rights --n4064f9.
44423:3	or like you say, maybe communication of knowing that, hey, up in other english colonies, or previous english colonies, everything is equal and yet down there it's not,
44423:61	or like you say, maybe communication of knowing that, hey, up in other english colonies, or previous english colonies, everything is equal and yet down there it's not,
44437:69	i think they tend --n407972 to be more educated, much more, educated than, than africa or the latin american countries.
44591:124	and, uh, she's been holding herself pretty well. the, uh, up until, you know, recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is --n401b9f --n401ba6
44651:51	you, they, they own you or, or, you know, grant you with you their presence, you know.
44672:63	and she knew whether to, to, to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over.
44700:132	like if i, if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours, uh, because i was going out. she would, uh, break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to, uh, to, to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did --n4048ee.
44700:145	like if i, if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours, uh, because i was going out. she would, uh, break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to, uh, to, to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did --n4048ee.
44813:11	so another five or six weeks i'll be bringing the little kitten over to, uh, to my folks.
44876:201	and i think one of the good ways of solving that is to like, everybody likes --n4006d4 to come to a party so have a voting party and, uh, you know, like in communities and have the issues there and then everybody go --n400757 vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something.
44972:48	like, uh, the top neighborhood, if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that, you know.
44973:128	i mean it doesn't have --n403105 to be, it could be like a, a sign that they would put --n403150 down at the end of your block. you know, or anything like that
45035:42	uh, and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first, second or third grade. so that the children develop good learning patterns
45097:54	now some people object during primaries, --n406251 having --n40625c to declare a party, whether republican or democrat
45132:18	and nobody ever showed us or anything
45163:48	where if they'd, if they'd had a class or something or just to a short time, you know, to, said okay, this is the way,
45163:53	where if they'd, if they'd had a class or something or just to a short time, you know, to, said okay, this is the way,
45265:18	she's had about four or five litters.
45369:51	and they let her tug their hair and, and get on their back or whatever
45375:98	i think it --n403284's good for kids to grow up around pets, as, as long as they don't have any allergies to them or anything.
45389:17	that or, or, uh, the other extreme,
45430:48	a dog you can tell --n4047ad, stop --n4047c0 barking, you know, or whatever.
45434:63	but the birds, you, it --n4048c5's hard to keep them from --n4048e8 squawking or whatever
45490:33	like you have a little bit of ocean with you or something.
45498:63	my daughter had a, like a little goldfish, a about a year or two ago
45511:60	you know, you can't roll around and tussle around with it like you can a dog or a cat
45547:102	and until we got the dog, um, it --n40678c was real easy to, to go to town for three d-, three day weekend or whatever,
45615:59	when, when we had our family dog --n40799e growing up --n4079ad i was eleven or twelve, i think --n4079d8, when we first got him --n4079f7,
45646:67	if you do not pick the trash --n408282 up, you know, the container, and put it on a table or chair or something, she'll knock it over,
45646:71	if you do not pick the trash --n408282 up, you know, the container, and put it on a table or chair or something, she'll knock it over,
45654:65	my cats do that it. if i through anything --n408621 away that --n408630's any kind of meat or anything, like that,
45877:58	because e-, everything, i mean anything that tom landry wanted or had --n403041, he was going --n403058 to change it.
45930:44	i hadn't heard, you know, whether they have a new one or not.
46012:28	i can't remember whether we played three or four quarterbacks,
46087:36	and then i'll, uh, normally check out the eagles or the patriots
46142:88	it was right close to when we was going --n407c92 to find out if we was going --n407cb5 to get --n407cc4 to be in the playoffs, or not --n407ceb.
46151:81	and they had --n40805e to kick. and, uh, --n408081 to know whether we were going --n4080a0 to win the game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us.
46192:69	but then at the ver-, in the fourth quarter they'd let them get up there either with them or, you know, right ahead of them.
46198:3	or we didn't.
46244:65	some, some places do have guard gates that you have --n400c65 to get through --n400c78, or electronic access gates and things like that.
46290:15	you got young boys or girls, that at fourteen or twelve years old that --n401c65 are committing murders
46290:33	you got young boys or girls, that at fourteen or twelve years old that --n401c65 are committing murders
46306:157	and, and i don't know if it's, uh, the family, you know, thing where they're not bonding anymore --n401f56, where mothers are working all the time and, the kids aren't getting the attention that they need --n401fad --n401fb4, or the television.
46322:34	they're just getting, uh, put --n40252a on probation or something, because the prisons don't have enough room
46380:139	i, i like the idea that, uh, if someone is from a foreign country, and they come to this country and uh, commit, a crime, i think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything, they should be immediately deported --n403d5a.
46424:21	like you take asian countries, or, uh, the eastern countries where women are like in the foreground, uh, in the background and the men are in the foreground --n404c4e,
46456:77	and he turned and asked this girl, and said, can you think of any place where dana shouldn't go --n40586b by herself, or anything.
46484:121	but i was thinking boy, in dallas, if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldn't go --n4062a2 by yourself at night, i'd have --n4062c9 to set them down for about five or ten minutes --n4062f8 to list all the places out.
46504:48	and i guess maybe that's the way tokyo is --n406c3c too, or japan is --n406c57 too.
46553:56	this plea bargaining baloney, where, uh, you know, they plead to a lesser crime, or, uh, they plead --n407a3a guilty in, or, you know, tell about someone else and they, they get less time --n407a99,
46553:95	this plea bargaining baloney, where, uh, you know, they plead to a lesser crime, or, uh, they plead --n407a3a guilty in, or, you know, tell about someone else and they, they get less time --n407a99,
46686:76	i mean, i've seen --n4012c2 and i've had friends that --n4012e1 have, uh, like, uh, --n401308 eighty-one or eighty, uh, celicas,
46727:54	, i mean, i didn't even, i didn't look around or anything
46782:51	i mean it looks, i guess, kind of like, uh, the chevy aerostar or arrow,
46878:53	you're looking at, you know, for a new r x seven or, a supra or something, you're looking at twenty-five k or something, that like
46878:62	you're looking at, you know, for a new r x seven or, a supra or something, you're looking at twenty-five k or something, that like
46878:88	you're looking at, you know, for a new r x seven or, a supra or something, you're looking at twenty-five k or something, that like
46885:80	anyway my ultimate car --n4051a0 though, the, the one that i really want --n4051cf is, uh, five sixty or so, mercedes,
46957:32	they're only going --n406243 to make like three or four thousand.
46988:18	i got off my pace or my cordless phone,
47277:3	or the, the,
47298:37	and then the nights are reasonably warm, you know, sixties or seventies.
47341:85	but i don't think i ever see it except when i go --n404c67 get out of the city and go --n404c8a camping in the desert or in, in the mountains --n404cb9.
47372:70	after that, if you asked me that i wouldn't have been able --n400315 to tell you if that was football or baseball.
47420:80	and i never had --n40175d to watch the news not, you know, not like some people hour and a half a day or anything.
47484:42	but i don't even know if they're still new york yankees, or mumblex new jersey.
47691:24	and, i mean, mumblex four or more children are thin,
47712:49	they don't say, they don't put mumblex on bad or anything which --n406bab is good because it --n406bc2 would be easy, i'm sure, for them to do that,
47787:16	but a lot women die or shop at foley's
47800:3	or you get pictures like we did.
47853:37	i, most of my friends have three or four kids
47891:23	now was this a one parent --n400a83 or two parent --n400a96 family.
47965:3	or they're stuck in a day care.
47991:62	so, so, you would have a job with a company. rather than, uh, radio or television or newspapers or, what have you --n402d34.
47991:66	so, so, you would have a job with a company. rather than, uh, radio or television or newspapers or, what have you --n402d34.
47991:70	so, so, you would have a job with a company. rather than, uh, radio or television or newspapers or, what have you --n402d34.
48005:83	and, uh, then you'd be willing --n402ee6 to give up your job --n402f01 to stay home and with, or stay with the children.
48019:111	but i'd like --n403544 to stay at home with them until they get in, at least into kindergarten, where they're at school from what, eight to three or something --n4035bf
48068:39	usually, uh, my husband was seldom home for maybe forty-five minutes or so
48175:48	and we tried --n406c70 to be a part of it but not overshadowing him or making him feel that we had --n406cbf to be there all the time.
48184:36	when i was your age --n4071c1 i didn't have this or that,
48229:108	well, on a scale of one to ten, uh, being --n4000e6 ten, no, kind of legislation and zero being, uh, total ban, i probably would lean more towards six or seven.
48239:3	or was that on rifles.
48254:34	the, the crime is not any better or any worse,
48293:58	i guess i have never heard of a, a robbery being foiled --n4019f8 or spoiled --n401a07 because the person who --n401a1e's being robbed --n401a31 had a gun.
48298:3	or i'm not sure
48299:3	or, you know, i can't think of --n401c9b ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who --n401cd6 was being robbed --n401ce9
48299:51	or, you know, i can't think of --n401c9b ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who --n401cd6 was being robbed --n401ce9
48299:56	or, you know, i can't think of --n401c9b ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who --n401cd6 was being robbed --n401ce9
48299:61	or, you know, i can't think of --n401c9b ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who --n401cd6 was being robbed --n401ce9
48321:3	or,
48363:20	you could see someone coming or dressed --n403749 inappropriately, you know,
48364:44	you-, if they had --n4037ff to have a rifle or was, you know,
48371:98	but i guess to make it more difficult for the person who --n403c46's just so irate and upset and, you know, temporarily a little bit, uh, offset or off keel,
48372:46	i don't know if that's a large percentage of, uh, crime or not
48855:166	uh, you know, it, it --n400bc2 really irks me to see so much effort put --n400bf5 into preventing someone being put --n400c14 to death by the state when they so callously and usually so, you know, without --n400c5f even thinking or without any concern, uh, you know, end somebody else's life, and in a lot of cases several people's lives --n400cd6.
48858:41	well, there's, there's probably two or three different types of, of views as far as the controversy goes.
48859:42	i can see where if a life was taken --n4011df by accident or, uh, i don't know what you'd call it --n401222, not premeditated or, i guess primarily by accident,, uh --n40125d, there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for --n401298 --n40129f,
48859:92	i can see where if a life was taken --n4011df by accident or, uh, i don't know what you'd call it --n401222, not premeditated or, i guess primarily by accident,, uh --n40125d, there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for --n401298 --n40129f,
48861:17	if it's premeditated or if it's, uh, kind of a habitual or, or a habit that, uh, a tendency that people, uh, may get into --n401574, then i guess i don't really have a problem with it.
48874:116	and, you know, i could go along with that, if, if i could be assured --n402122 that it would be their natural life in jail and not parole after ten, or twelve years.
48881:37	and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in mesquite who --n4024f4 was out in six months..
48881:44	and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in mesquite who --n4024f4 was out in six months..
48899:163	you know, that's, that's no kind of deterrent because we, we've got literally hundreds of people on death row, and, and many of them who --n40304a have been there --n40305d for literally for ten or fifteen years on death row,
48909:46	and you can, probably spend, uh, a lot of time, uh, or maybe eventually, uh, just waiting it out,
48916:100	and that's where a lot of aggravation comes --n4038f4, i think, is, is, uh, these guys spend so much time in the appeal process or just in the waiting process,
48948:95	and just, just ever so often she mentions, well, she's got --n404aef to do something else, you know, write another letter, or do something.
49162:40	they were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the navy,
49185:66	let's say typical, say three bedroom, uh, two and a half baths, on a half acre or so of land,
49242:55	like most areas that --n403eaa are built --n403eb9, um, there were probably, like two or three styles you could choose from --n403f08.
49249:47	i'm, i'm only about, uh, twelve miles or so from the, uh, border of washington d c, and montgomery county,
49272:69	and they bought their home in i, i want --n40487b to say like --n40488e around nineteen seventy-five or something like that,
49324:208	on a, on a, on a, what we would, you know, what you described --n405b39 as your house and what i would describe --n405b60 as my house say, for example, in pensacola, florida, on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on, might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes.
49341:37	uh, so, the question of whether to buy here or move to another county, say, drive twenty more miles north, buy a condominium for approximately, uh, the same price, maybe a little lower,
49399:23	but for example, a curriculum supervisor or principal or someone, you know, in that, uh, in that range.
49399:28	but for example, a curriculum supervisor or principal or someone, you know, in that, uh, in that range.
49539:30	they're worse than american cars i think or just as bad as far as resale goes.
49602:79	i, uh, i was thinking about --n403165 buying a prelude from a friend who --n403188 was moving to new york or something
49701:44	supposedly, the maintenance records was supposed --n404fd0 to be registered --n404fe3 with honda or whatever
49825:209	but i think, uh, actually, uh, in, in --n4017ab trying --n4017b6 to follow, uh, you know the cowboys over the years i think, uh, uh, they used --n401815 to have a, um, a philosophy for, well i don't know, probably the last twenty-five years except for about the last about five or six years uh,
49833:71	but they would go out and try --n401cd7 to go for, uh, the best people and then mold them into different areas or find their natural niche.
49837:31	and then about five years ago, four or five years ago, uh, they started --n401e7e going after, uh, uh, specific players or positions, you know,
49837:83	and then about five years ago, four or five years ago, uh, they started --n401e7e going after, uh, uh, specific players or positions, you know,
49873:3	or what was the whole deal on that --n402eea.
49914:54	you, know, i guess it's the same way with baseball or, or anybody, you know,
50001:63	i guess it was january, when, um, jimmy johnson got named --n4061f0 coach of the year or whatever --n40620f.
50054:20	is it the, the wharf or the, the, uh inner harbor.
50077:84	so it's, um, real easy access from, from south of baltimore like, um, like the airport or more importantly for the orioles from washington d c.
50175:41	you know, i mean you can't please them one way or the other.
50274:139	well, and, and, and so many of the, so many of the conflicts, um, really don't have a basis in, in, uh, politics or, or human rights or anything like that.
50274:149	well, and, and, and so many of the, so many of the conflicts, um, really don't have a basis in, in, uh, politics or, or human rights or anything like that.
50432:162	it's, it's, uh, there, there is, there is, it --n405d0f's an overall problem in, in, in this country understanding, uh, foreign cultures, or even accepting them.
50456:116	you know, we, we've got folks running around here who --n40675f get, who --n406776 get degrees in basket weaving and you know, underwater psychology, or some, some ridiculous stuff like that.
50514:57	we're, we're going --n40770a to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later.
50680:36	what do you think --n400022 about the, uh, peace corps or public service commitment.
50688:92	but there are an awful lot of young people who --n400580 would benefit from, um, some sort of public service, like the conservation corps back in the thirties or, uh, various other things of that sort.
50706:78	it --n400d60 would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned --n400d9f that --n400daa were during the depression or coming out of the depression available for kids.
50711:45	the, the difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or involuntary.
50729:28	they were allowed --n40168d to do hospital service or, uh, things like that,
50731:3	or farm work in world war one i remember uh, --n4017cb reading about --n4017da.
50849:39	i don't know if it's a government run --n404317 --n40431e or if it's a private --n40433d --n404344 charity that --n404353's put it together.
50921:62	uh, the special on channel thirteen that --n400251 was broadcast --n400260, i think --n400273, last week or so ago, it detailed how this one person went about --n4002b6 finding out this particular pers-, from this particular person his home mortgage, how much he pays --n400305 for it, what his payments are --n400328, uh, his, uh, social security number, driver's license, any kind of records he may have --n40038b. uh, their credit card and the status of their credit --n4003c2.
50989:3	or,
51013:3	or the computers, the, the big advent of that, i believe --n402649, because it, they can all hold such large data bases on anybody that all you have --n40269c to do --n4026ab is touch a button
51019:56	i, i know the government sells information --n4029a4 to private companies about individuals or families.
51052:3	or, it's mostly the private information that we're all concerned about --n403867.
51368:32	i mean, i've been to like thirty or forty games each of the last few years.
51519:98	so, that way i didn't think, y-, you know, the house would be, y-, you know, cleaned --n401cb5 or anything for me specifically.
51527:40	and i want --n401ec4 to say her daughter was like six or seven, right around first, second grade.
51548:67	and she literally spent almost the entire amount that i paid her --n4028fd on my daughter. --n402914 either making her clothes or, buying her things.
51594:63	like, i noticed a lot of these other schools that i went and interviewed on, or interviewed at --n4036df, um, they did a lot of play work and stuff.
51633:46	it --n404355's hard to tell how much --n404378 has been that or how much --n404397 is just her.
51672:30	do you have any l-, nieces or nephews then.
51683:40	i mean, he has always got some kind of, cold or something.
51839:12	or or, if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could, you know, go, in and get one --n407481.
51851:24	or, you know, or a car accident.
52016:33	i haven't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months,
52021:19	but i rent probably four or five movies a week.
52068:3	or do you like, uh, just action
52069:3	or,
52109:47	when that first came out --n401c57, i really did not expect the special effects or anything like that.
52123:56	now, i, i also liked, uh, oh, gone with the wind or some of the classic, like the lawrence of arabia.
52189:3	or go --n403336 rent it.
52191:66	and, a lot of times, what i wind up --n4033ba doing --n4033c5 is, picking say an actor or an actress, and seeing like all,
52200:60	i guess you could do that, you know, get all of david carradine's movies, or, uh, uh, segal,
52264:50	there's something about people coming up through the sofa --n404c34 to get you, or something, you know, coming out of the t v that --n404c7f just doesn't make my day, you know.
52336:38	i've, we've seen that two or three times.
52433:93	he, he happens --n4079ad to be, uh, a friend of one of her, her business associates. and, or, not, not a friend, a cousin, a cousin.
52499:80	i don-, i don't think our prison system isn't set --n400994 up, where we, um, rehabilitate, or, you know, restore anybody --n4009db.
52509:46	like the alcoholic that --n4011d6 charges up all the bills on the credit card, or the shopaholic, you know you get your life right with god
52648:55	i would like --n405294 to see some, some kind of reform, or some kind of streamlining so that, if a person is, um, convicted --n405317, and sentenced --n40532a to, to death, that that automatic appeal which --n405365 goes in could be more quickly dealt with --n40538c.
52656:78	and, and go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way, because it --n405682 doesn't do the criminal or the victim's family, r-, r-, any of us, the taxpayer any good to have him sitting around for months and years.
52732:129	because too, too often, there can be extremism that, that --n407dcc hurts from, from any direction, regardless of wha-, whatever you're arguing --n407e1b or concerned --n407e2a about --n407e35.
52759:95	uh, we try --n400251 to go once, maybe twice a summer. uh, we, uh, just, you know, for like a short weekend or something.
52774:3	or do you have a camper.
53051:81	and, well, we've driven through, and, you know, but, but not, you know, camping or anything.
53606:55	apparently, i, i don't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too.
53653:87	i think there were places around downtown fort worth last night they got three inches --n405a6a in a real short period of time, like an hour or so just, a bunch --n405ab5.
53755:69	i mean, what does this have --n40221c to do --n40222b with getting, you know, a computer science degree or whatever, you know.
53803:103	and they were talking about the plano school system, that, they had one school that, uh, if the students did something wrong, i mean, whether it was behavioral or, uh, you know, they weren't learning properly or something. they took these students and put them basically in a closet. with no windows --n4037d4.
53803:138	and they were talking about the plano school system, that, they had one school that, uh, if the students did something wrong, i mean, whether it was behavioral or, uh, you know, they weren't learning properly or something. they took these students and put them basically in a closet. with no windows --n4037d4.
53823:87	putting them in, i mean, they were, they were call-, they called them --n404519 their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms.
53971:22	it's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend.
54186:85	and --n40180b being up here we pretty much treat everybody, you know, as someone that --n40184e has merit, even if they're poor, or if they're hispanic or if they're black.
54186:100	and --n40180b being up here we pretty much treat everybody, you know, as someone that --n40184e has merit, even if they're poor, or if they're hispanic or if they're black.
54358:17	they've got sixty or so of iraq's planes.
54571:48	a lot of things we try --n40314f to catch --n40315e like at the dollar theater or matinees
54645:43	you see it for, uh, you know a couple of hours or an hour
54655:16	who's your favorite actress or actor --n4046b7.
54703:34	and i think it was like a three hour movie or two and a half hours,
54761:52	it was on one of the networks, i think --n4064f0 last weekend. uh, or two weeks ago.
54841:46	do you go by the ads --n407d2f when you look at them --n407d4a, or the reviews.
54911:3	or, uh,
54952:27	is that the one set in the fifties, or sixties.
55095:35	if they figure they have got it won --n4038a5 or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or, uh, if, uh, if something happens that that adrenalin starts --n403918 flowing.
55095:67	if they figure they have got it won --n4038a5 or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or, uh, if, uh, if something happens that that adrenalin starts --n403918 flowing.
55105:3	or who do you, who do you like --n403f66 to do that this year.
55109:29	i think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year,
55117:40	uh, i'm figuring either one either the eagles or possibly san francisco
55123:44	so, i don't know how these changes are going --n404696 to help or hinder the team --n4046b5,
55179:28	i just got back last night around eleven thirty or so,
55257:54	they have a university in moscow called the patrice de lamumba university. about like a and m or u t, where they're teachings subjects like that --n4018c6,
55284:17	there's probably five or six, which --n4029ce would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs, that --n402a05 are in positions over some of these soviet states.
55403:21	but by no means do i endorse or approve pulling everybody out.
55430:5	, or we have a fish tank,
55476:37	i mean, i'm not big, you know, or anything,
55488:50	but i don't have --n401e8f to be conscious of what i'm doing --n401eb6 or how i'm doing it --n401ed5.
55495:27	and no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing --n4022c9.
55512:3	or what is,
55571:16	no big deal one way or the other.
55620:26	because no matter what i did --n40480c or how i did it --n404827, i invariably got myself wet.
55653:23	especially when you're on cement or anything that --n4050cf's hard --n4050de,
55759:30	i think i have gone home maybe once or twice --n407212 slightly sore.
55769:54	but usually, when i go into the hot tub --n4074bd before i go --n4074d0 swimming, or when i come out --n4074f3, i'm totally relaxed when i go home --n40751e.
55814:50	but if i were you, i would go --n40886c apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while.
55859:43	i just don't know if, you know, i was eighteen or whatever, i'd want --n400b18 to be stuck --n400b2b doing it for a year or whatever.
55859:90	i just don't know if, you know, i was eighteen or whatever, i'd want --n400b18 to be stuck --n400b2b doing it for a year or whatever.
55875:44	and i could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever.
55876:71	but i, i felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone, or go into a military situation, that they could help the country in other ways. be it cleaning out, uh, lots, in, in their neighborhood or, whatever kind of community or public service --n40148d might be available.
55876:168	but i, i felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone, or go into a military situation, that they could help the country in other ways. be it cleaning out, uh, lots, in, in their neighborhood or, whatever kind of community or public service --n40148d might be available.
55876:186	but i, i felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone, or go into a military situation, that they could help the country in other ways. be it cleaning out, uh, lots, in, in their neighborhood or, whatever kind of community or public service --n40148d might be available.
55886:44	since we live here and we all --n401a30 benefit, rich, poor or in between, uh, there are benefits even for those who --n401a7f have it the hardest.
55901:89	things that --n402776 need --n402781 to be done --n402794, that --n4027a3 wou-, that --n4027b6 could be done --n4027c9 in an hour or two, uh, a day, or several hours of the week. like a half of a day on saturday or something like that. in addition to what one does --n402864, uh, besides that.
55901:107	things that --n402776 need --n402781 to be done --n402794, that --n4027a3 wou-, that --n4027b6 could be done --n4027c9 in an hour or two, uh, a day, or several hours of the week. like a half of a day on saturday or something like that. in addition to what one does --n402864, uh, besides that.
55901:149	things that --n402776 need --n402781 to be done --n402794, that --n4027a3 wou-, that --n4027b6 could be done --n4027c9 in an hour or two, uh, a day, or several hours of the week. like a half of a day on saturday or something like that. in addition to what one does --n402864, uh, besides that.
55955:33	it might not be the same neighborhood, but the same city or county, because then you're, you're coming in contact with it.
56013:64	there definitely would have --n405618 to be a major p r campaign in each community, each county, uh, parish or however the state was divided --n40567b up --n405686.
56020:11	boy scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will, uh, police a, uh a couple of miles of the highway and kee-,
56020:18	boy scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will, uh, police a, uh a couple of miles of the highway and kee-,
56045:26	should these people be allowed --n406220 to or not.
56132:8	uh, or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say, oh, my goodness, now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology.
56144:47	just about anybody you could name --n409869, whether i voted for them or not, uh, makes, um, uh, decisions that i just can't go along with --n4098d8.
56162:3	or i will.
56203:3	or you can just get some, you know, regular red peppers.
56269:71	and in a like a, oh, what do you call it --n40189b. like pyrex or something like that, kind of bowl that --n4018d2 would go in the microwave.
56468:15	are they thin, long or wide.
56528:40	but, uh, do you have --n405ac3 to have a certain skillet, or something.
56560:81	but it really, it's not, it, it, it doesn't burn or anything like that.
56573:79	that's really, it's not like you would have --n4065c1 to cook it for an extreme amount of time, or something like that, --n406604 to get it,
56736:3	or you can make it with seafood.
56764:49	um, it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population demographically, or in terms of their opinions.
56805:32	and now we're up to proposition a hundred and fifty or something like that.
56808:39	and you had --n401d55 to vote for, you know, yes or no on each of them
56809:19	and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them
56899:10	like three or four percent of australians don't vote
56901:45	i don't know if they actually are fined --n403d30 or, or what --n403d47 happens,
56929:196	when they especially when someone, they,, they don't vote for someone because they don't like any of them and then the person gets in and they don't like him and he turns out --n404ac4 to have been worse than her that they might have voted for --n404afb, or something like that --n404b16.
56988:61	perhaps that would be a solution if they were required --n4066ce to vote at least for their first three or four years after they become of voting age. required --n406721 to register and vote for four years,
56999:3	or certain privileges --n406a17 come from voting which --n406a32 aren't that important but are nice to have --n406a65,
57052:64	um, oh, hamilt-, i think it was hamilton who --n407deb wrote number ten or something, where he was arguing for a republican --n407e26, not in the sense of the republican party now, versus a democratic --n407e65, uh, government and, arguing successfully, why, the united states should be a republic, not a democracy. which indeed it really is --n407edc --n407ee3 --n407eea,
57065:58	because just as you can have a tyranny of a single, um, you know, bad ruler or something, you can have a tyranny of the majority.
57073:61	if there's some minority that people don't like --n408cb0 because of, you know, racial hatred or something like that, the majority can just simply vote again-, vote against them.
57117:47	and then on friday most everybody wears jeans, jeans and sweatshirts, or, you know, jeans and blouses or something like that.
57117:68	and then on friday most everybody wears jeans, jeans and sweatshirts, or, you know, jeans and blouses or something like that.
57118:38	uh, but mostly what i wear --n40084f are skirts and blouses or, you know, skirts and, uh, pullover sweaters or, uh, you know, little two piece dress suit, suits like,
57118:70	uh, but mostly what i wear --n40084f are skirts and blouses or, you know, skirts and, uh, pullover sweaters or, uh, you know, little two piece dress suit, suits like,
57140:44	like, um, in the warm weather it's always shorts and a t-shirt or a button up or something like that
57140:53	like, um, in the warm weather it's always shorts and a t-shirt or a button up or something like that
57141:38	and then in the winter time it's jeans or, or pants.
57144:100	you really don't want --n401510 to dress up unless you, you, uh, have a job and you have --n401557 to be there right after school or something like that,
57155:40	and they dress up like when customers are coming in --n401c43, or, uh, when we have department meetings or something like that --n401c82.
57155:66	and they dress up like when customers are coming in --n401c43, or, uh, when we have department meetings or something like that --n401c82.
57177:94	and, uh, you know, whenever he was going to school --n40249c, he was expecting --n4024b3 to --n4024be having --n4024c9 to wear, uh, a tie or a dress shirt everyday.
57221:29	but, uh, he didn't carry any ties or anything because he, he just went over there with the that attitude, well if i don't take it then they won't make me wear it.
57328:19	or, um, or she wouldn't buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that
57406:27	i think maybe it was nine ninety-nine or something.
57422:16	wasn't a seam or anything, you know.
57456:68	i haven't gotten really involved in anything, uh, extensive in car repairs in, oh, oh, probably a year or so.
57469:83	and most of them now, you know, you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or, or fuel injected
57472:3	or fuel injected,
57492:29	you know, they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that, uh, the guys, average guys can't really go out in the, in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs,
57643:27	i'm convinced that, uh, detroit or whoever it is --n40495a made a major mistake, years ago when they stopped --n404989 putting the small v eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes --n4049d0.
57651:59	i'm convinced that the small v eight like the, the mustang's original two eighty-nine or some of the chevy two eighty-threes, were good little v eight engines that --n404c14 were not gas guzzlers
57665:107	little, you know, not whole lot more than the, than the, than the six cylinder that i think --n405109 was like about two thirty-five or so.
57691:21	it was a three oh, seven or something like that,
57709:45	the friend of ours over here, he's got, uh, sixty-five, or sixty-six mustang the six cylinder.
57725:23	i guess it's an eighty-nine or ninety, uh, chrysler something or other.
57725:39	i guess it's an eighty-nine or ninety, uh, chrysler something or other.
57802:67	it's, it's the, it's usually that power steering --n4086df be-, or something that --n4086fe's way back in there.
57817:48	so i guess i've done probably, uh, i'd say seven or eight of them.
57821:26	this is the first one in a week or so.
57825:52	so i don't know, if, if it's tapering off, or what.
57827:34	if ta-, it's winding down or what.
57838:18	maybe they're burnt out or,
57886:97	i-, it frustrates him because of the support that they have --n40123f and the support that the vietnam vets did not have --n40126e, from the people or the administration, either one.
57920:78	and i, i agree with you also, that i feel like it --n402576 was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war.
57956:30	uh, you know whether it was justified or not, i know, that --n403318 they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause.
57971:96	and he did pull out before it got any further than that where, where it would have turned into more of a police action. uh, or more of a political action i guess, --n403c5e you getting into their governmental affairs which you really can't do --n403c95 as, as another country.
58159:41	because, you know until the la-, past four or five years, nobody ever really worried about that, for them.
58247:123	and the problem is that we tried --n400fc1 to convert everything from inches to centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than saying no, a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail, or whatever, and, you know, and leaving it at that
58315:64	but human nature being such as it is, i would think it would take, probably, two or three years before people co-, could completely cut the cord.
58323:63	i didn't mean, you know, i didn't mean like sweden going over to right hand drive or anything, you know,
58324:29	at midnight, tonight we all switch over or anything.
58386:114	and if you start --n404e0a expressing one liters and one kilograms and then the pounds come in the, the, you know, the odd numbers, you know, two point two pounds or something. i think people will start --n404ead getting a sense of, gee the metric is the sensible one.
58537:64	and then she makes noodles with, uh, with, s-, soy sauce or whatever,
58578:8	saint jack or something.
58583:3	or, yeah, mumblex.
58773:18	i tried it like once or twice
58841:3	or do you, do you get into that's, that,
58865:50	and, um, the sticky buns, of course, would last, you know three or four days
58957:22	but you pinch off a portion, or save a portion of it for the next time, or something.
58957:51	but you pinch off a portion, or save a portion of it for the next time, or something.
59047:56	i thought for sure, i thought for sure you were in dallas or something.
59170:38	well, uh, the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so.
59184:37	i mean, they may let you off for a day or two --n4004d7 to have your baby,
59189:3	or either they'll have a computer at home --n400629 and in the hospital --n400640 where you can just, you know, just continue right on with your work --n400683.
59205:6	two or three, you know, um.
59303:31	and, if i'd of probably had three or four children, i don't see how --n4031b2 we could have made it, you know, without me working --n4031e9.
59327:20	because if you have two or three kids, by the, e-, way the inflation's going --n403c94 i think a woman's always going --n403cbb to have --n403cca to work
59383:29	you know, you've been married three or so years
59490:3	or we go on trips,
59492:3	or, you know, just the more or less like entertainment stuff,
59492:33	or, you know, just the more or less like entertainment stuff,
59539:31	like you said if you had four kids, or even if you had two kids, you would be paying all your salary --n40956a to pay for those two kids to go.
59548:36	i don't know if the t i in dallas does or not.
59616:52	and it --n401976 doesn't matter what restrictions you put --n401999 on that type of weapon or a class three firearm.
59663:29	they'll get it across the border one way or the other.
59686:38	but whether it be the, your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun. you got --n403692 to go through their course and get certified --n4036b9 that you know how to properly handle the weapon --n4036e8, how to safely handle the weapon --n40370f, how to properly maintain it --n403732, the three basics.
59713:207	what --n404915 is happening at least in this state and i expect --n404948 to see it in other states very soon, legislation --n404977 been introduced --n404986 as that, if a citizen of the state, --n4049b5 being, myself, has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons course, i can carry a weapon --n404a14 on me at all times concealed or uncon-, unconcealed --n404a43.
59796:50	now whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not, that's another trip,
59808:31	in defense of myself, defense of my family or defense of my friends i can blow somebody a way in a heart beat. even, even more so when it comes to my, my wife and son --n406e9f.
59957:3	or at least it, it --n402d1a wouldn't hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better,
59959:3	or,
59964:14	or, or what we've got --n402fa1,
59982:90	and there's, you know, there's people in our prisons that --n403315 are not being rehabilitated --n40332c in any way, shape, or form,
59987:3	or when they get out --n403504 they're, you know, it's a matter of a few months
59994:62	we're just not willing to set a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes --n40377e,
60210:34	then i would do it, you know, everyday or two days so i would clean that pan very, very rarely,
60245:66	but i think that for me, well, my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat.
60261:35	but he was, no, completely against having a dog or cat,
60440:51	and then she grew --n407aee to be pretty big, you know, like a pound or something
60448:27	and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while i was working, and things like that. yeah, much more than you would think.
60492:50	it --n408b22's not fair to a pet --n408b41 to have a pet here, or certainly, certainly not a dog,
60507:76	you see all these people, yeah, these stately people, and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them,
60562:60	are they, um, just what you call --n40a07f it, are they breed cats or anything
60563:3	or are they just,
60594:49	both, yeah, both females, they're both spayed, um, or whatever it is --n40aa4d, neutered, you know,, um,
60705:26	now is that ad good just to colorado or to colorado springs.
60719:29	well, you in the, uh, computer operations or in the actual, uh, manufacturing.
60738:6	exempt or mumblex.
60776:3	or i, i'm significantly shaken --n403390 by the situation, but not devastated --n4033b3.
60814:35	so, despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or, or going for walks in the mountains, i can't seem --n40408b to get into it right now.
60814:53	so, despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or, or going for walks in the mountains, i can't seem --n40408b to get into it right now.
60833:25	but, or, or even somewhere better,
60860:25	for the last many years i've more or less let them direct what i want --n40508e to do --n40509d, and where i want --n4050b8 to go --n4050c7. and just kind of go with the punches.
61043:3	or,
61077:85	but i would think it --n403a13 would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down strean-, or stream or such,
61081:3	or you can, you can, you know, do, uh, testing on the ground itself at that point,
61087:89	unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution --n40405e, you know, like in los angeles or, or the bigger cities where it, it tends --n4040bd to get stuck --n4040d0 there --n4040db,
61114:43	it's, it's where stillwater is --n404a35 or, sweet,
61154:107	and i read in this article, i couldn't believe it, where, you know, like, one cow produces, like, a day, produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure --n40569d --n4056a4.
61383:88	and, i would think, you know, he might, i mean, he might could get hurt --n400d68 by a car or something.
61481:34	they don't care what you look like --n4026ff, or what you act like --n40271e,
61534:25	well, have you put any posters up or anything like that.
61608:108	and when he's not right at the door in the morning --n404d19 i really worry that something's happened to him, that somebody, he's got in a fight or, you know, somebody's hit him
61646:74	any cat that --n4058fd comes near, and even a dog he won't, he won't jump at them or anything,
61667:103	but if you want him to be and he doesn't want --n40620a to be, he'll just, he'll, you know either scratch you or run away.
61706:3	or they'll rub their, their head against you, you know.
61870:40	and if they don't have their booster, any kind of saliva or anything from another cat,
61942:3	or if you don't want --n4015a2 to build a data base to keep track of the nuts and bolts in your garage,
61981:60	you can actually buy a whole brand new computer with a not not a necessarily a slow one or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars.
62188:33	well, i don't know if i know anything or not,
62228:124	and i know, that like if you have college notes, if you teach in a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much --n401196 and they cancel part of your, you know, your college note or whatever.
62252:27	i mean, it's a nursing home or something like that.
62281:38	we wouldn't have --n40274c to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that.
62340:105	i don't, i don't know that you could require everyone to, do that for, yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that,
62340:112	i don't, i don't know that you could require everyone to, do that for, yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that,
62367:43	but say, i think bangladesh --n4046c3 would have been a good example or some, some really desperate situation
62382:115	there are people --n404cad now that --n404cbc are obsolete point and fact just, just like endangered species of animals, so there are quote tribes of people, that --n404d1f are endangered or obsolete.
62411:39	and i don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either.
62433:170	and maybe rather than just, require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required --n40607d to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the united states --n4060dc.
62456:3	or,, what was it --n406d6c
62458:105	i mean, and that's not really the answer, i mean, because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend, it on, you know, booze or something like that,
62515:3	or, um, i'm not sure whether i've had --n400233 to return that many things, uh,
62529:81	and then we could talk a bit about, um, just quality of products in general, if y-, they're better or worse like if they last longer or something like that.
62529:102	and then we could talk a bit about, um, just quality of products in general, if y-, they're better or worse like if they last longer or something like that.
62541:16	but for the last four or five years i've had eye problem,
62610:3	or slots is what it's called --n401dbf --n401dc6.
62820:176	i think just, uh, just, uh, one of the maj-, major, i think it was a, you know, i don't, i think it was, uh, you know, like a highlands or something like this.
62903:64	and it kind of has --n4084e9 to start from the top and, and go clea-, or from the bottom maybe and go clear up.
63199:38	like when i walk --n404784 i'll take along a radio or something
63267:3	or i have a headache
63268:3	or,
63303:47	i don't really feel like --n406bcd going in the grocery store --n406be8 all sweaty or running errands.
63322:3	or,
63429:67	well, does it --n4097d3 cost money like to use the, to exercise in the weight room or to, uh, to tak-, to go swimming.
63494:94	i think they just ought --n400abf to, you know, start, uh, just go all the way on new products introduced or whatever, you know, start your packaging, go to liters instead of quarts,
63539:30	but by the time i was in fifth or sixth grade --n40205b anyway.
63544:80	i would expect people with any kind of buying power over the age, you know, under the age of thirty or so, to have some idea what it is --n40219f, anyway.
63557:114	but, you know, it's like somebody said, okay as of such and such a date, you know, anybody caught talking in the english, you know, will be shot --n402887 or something like that, you know.
63572:13	there's one or two others that --n402de7 just,
63575:56	because all you end up --n402f84 doing --n402f8f is if you're in business or you're in any kind of international,
63647:23	it's like a half a liter or something like that.
63657:95	i would have more problem more problem with the temperature, except that, you know, --n404c19 working in engineering, we do everything in centigrade, or celsius.
63668:135	so, but, uh. the big problem is not having the, uh, the resolution between temperature, you know, between a hundred, if you're talking about a hundred degrees or what, thirty, zero, you know thirty four degrees, whatever that is --n405228.
63674:32	you know, the differences between seventy and seventy-two or seventy-five degrees isn't much,
63720:4	or who, you know,
63755:97	i thought maybe they would convert to, uh, metric back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit --n4075c1, because what is it --n4075dc fifty-six or fifty-seven's a hundred, uh, qua-, a hundred kilometers,
63801:6	sooner or later they'll start --n408565 putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start --n4085a8 thinking that way.
63851:162	well, rowlett had sent, sent out a survey --n400ee0, not too long ago, um, in terms in how many people --n400f1f were interested in --n400f32 having a, a pick up, i guess, on the days they do trash --n400f7d or something like that.
63853:64	i don't know how, how soon they're going --n401313 to do it --n401326, or how organized it's going --n401349 to be --n401358,
63914:33	i, i noticed at the library or someplace this past, uh, month, month and a half ago, they were having a speaker, um, talk about doing lawn work and, h-, how important it --n402a96 is --n402aa1 to, to cut your lawn without a bag. just to kind of mulch it, rather than bag it up, because of a-, all the the grass that --n402b44's being bagged --n402b57 and being hauled --n402b6a away by the garbage trucks and stuff,
63962:59	uh, one of the questions was, do you think more --n403f8d should be done --n403fa0, or something else.
63983:38	but the cost is, is like, double or sometimes triple, what the regular things you, fertilizers and things you buy --n404b3f.
63992:68	companies that --n404fcf do at least go into it, i'd like --n404ffe to see subsidy by the government or something, or tax-wise or something, heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular --n40506d.
63992:75	companies that --n404fcf do at least go into it, i'd like --n404ffe to see subsidy by the government or something, or tax-wise or something, heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular --n40506d.
63992:81	companies that --n404fcf do at least go into it, i'd like --n404ffe to see subsidy by the government or something, or tax-wise or something, heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular --n40506d.
64034:29	and, they don't expand or, or contract when the weather changes --n4060d7,
64108:18	do you live in plano or work in plano, or both.
64108:31	do you live in plano or work in plano, or both.
64126:3	or are you, uh, spring creek.
64225:3	or keep one handy. because it's, it rains a lot in alaska.
64427:90	and, uh, and they're supposed --n40559c to be building a mall somewhere close by, by the next, by ninety-three or ninety-four or something,
64427:94	and, uh, and they're supposed --n40559c to be building a mall somewhere close by, by the next, by ninety-three or ninety-four or something,
64521:3	or used --n406e95 to anyway.
64537:26	is it along the coast or or inland.
64659:21	i missed that one of eighty or eighty-two or eighty-one that --n408e1a had the heat wave.
64659:25	i missed that one of eighty or eighty-two or eighty-one that --n408e1a had the heat wave.
64760:20	whenever they say it two or three times --n4017aa.
64785:92	and as soon as you go down to salisbury, this town that --n401e01's, you know, uh, two and a half hours away in the suburbs or whatever, uh, in a real rural balt-, uh, maryland, they, it turns into ber-, basically classic rock.
64794:5	oldies or what.
64802:146	if, you know, like when the doors movie came out --n4022bf, you know, doors was really on the radio --n4022ee there, you know. where, you know, you'd hear was-, one or two of their more famous songs, maybe top forty in baltimore --n402369,
64898:51	i like --n403b70 to listen to tapes, uh, of music or, or, um, stuff on a long trip.
64913:3	or what-, she's losing her sight or whatever.
64913:35	or what-, she's losing her sight or whatever.
65173:42	uh, not as good as it would have been say three or four years ago.
65331:25	i don't really read the self-improvement books or things like that.
65362:46	but it --n4020a7's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so.
65406:20	i must have like fifty or sixty books by him.
65646:59	and, uh, we usually sit there unless somebody gives us tickets, you know, box seats or something,
65785:3	or,
65821:19	it was like john feinstein or something like that --n40b336 wrote it.
65878:34	because i think it's all funded, either state or federally funded
65879:14	so, or, uh, obviously.
65890:83	well, see the other way i'm thinking about --n401021 is they should be self-supporting, like, uh, the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons. anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves --n4010b0.
65890:88	well, see the other way i'm thinking about --n401021 is they should be self-supporting, like, uh, the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons. anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves --n4010b0.
65915:22	as far as this, that good or bad or what.
65915:26	as far as this, that good or bad or what.
65937:74	why not an apprentice out to a, a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or, you know, just a technician --n402a35.
65988:45	and all of a sudden we had a bad, uh, frequency --n404685 there or something.
65999:156	but, uh, you know, i think, uh, they, maybe they need --n404923 to, uh, help --n40493e promote that more. give incentives like, uh, if they do bring somebody on, they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is --n4049c5, you know, for them to train people, you know, stuff like that.
65999:166	but, uh, you know, i think, uh, they, maybe they need --n404923 to, uh, help --n40493e promote that more. give incentives like, uh, if they do bring somebody on, they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is --n4049c5, you know, for them to train people, you know, stuff like that.
66023:36	it was like only, it was either sixty percent or forty percent, go to college.
66046:44	because you can get just as far as --n4064be being a journeyman, carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that. make as much money
66046:51	because you can get just as far as --n4064be being a journeyman, carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that. make as much money
66046:55	because you can get just as far as --n4064be being a journeyman, carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that. make as much money
66101:3	or, in fact, one has finished now.
66157:3	or,
66160:137	or if they've sent you a, uh, a number that you can use --n401e98. you know, a, a personal identification number that you can use --n401ee3 in the, uh, impact machines or whatever, you, you can do that.
66190:44	so i thought, man, i don't know if i trust this or not.
66202:3	or the ones that --n403388 usually have an outstanding balance all the time, i'll, i'll pay more than the minimum payment.
66214:51	because we never know when we might, you know, get laid --n403a9b off or something --n403aae.
66266:3	or, uh, they, they've signed for a friend.
66335:35	if you've got a charge off on your credit report or something like that.
66340:37	or something you haven't paid --n406397 in sixty days or ninety days, you know. and things like that.
66362:55	i would think it wouldn't be, you know, much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges --n406b75.
66523:82	anyway, well the question is, you know, do you think, i-, it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think it can if it's done --n401c82 right.
66523:100	anyway, well the question is, you know, do you think, i-, it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think it can if it's done --n401c82 right.
66545:3	or the courts don't convict them,
66546:14	or, or they don't serve very much of the time
66575:42	i mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that, i mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder --n4034d8.
66676:23	now whether they finally got it or not, i don't know --n406786.
66725:58	i think, uh, now if you're dealing drugs now, caught more than twice or something, uh, it, there's, uh, a death penalty associated with it.
66744:39	you, never know when they're going --n4088a7 to turn or hurt the next person --n4088ca because it --n4088d9 doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt --n40890c or not.
66744:103	you, never know when they're going --n4088a7 to turn or hurt the next person --n4088ca because it --n4088d9 doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt --n40890c or not.
66791:42	i think that's considered --n4006f9 exercise whether you want it or not.
66844:3	or i did something.
67234:22	regardless whether it's north dallas or whatnot, when she goes over to this fitness center --n40719c, it's fenced --n4071b3 in,
67363:20	like, a bunch of hills or pretty flat.
67396:24	do you ride a lot of rallies or a lot of those around there.
67423:47	so i began a program couple, i don't know probably three or four weeks ago
67430:26	i usually, you know, fifteen or twenty.
67459:46	i just wondered if you were going --n4030f0 to do that --n403103 mostly or more like, you know, uh, uh, touring like from vermont or, you know, that kind of, thing.
67459:88	i just wondered if you were going --n4030f0 to do that --n403103 mostly or more like, you know, uh, uh, touring like from vermont or, you know, that kind of, thing.
67486:48	i mean, around texas, you, you got about five or six,
67487:36	if you live around the dallas area, you got five or six --n403ac2 every weekend to choose from --n403ae5. because they're really into it.
67503:35	and, you know, you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that, --n403efc or above the age of fifteen or something,
67503:67	and, you know, you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that, --n403efc or above the age of fifteen or something,
67503:87	and, you know, you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that, --n403efc or above the age of fifteen or something,
67512:40	i mean, maybe it's because of the winters. uh, or maybe just because, you know, there's, there's a lot more flat lands, you know, out in the west.
67546:47	oh, i guess as an adult for just about the past, uh, three years or so.
67555:107	have you ever had a, uh, it's kind of slightly off the subject, but you ever had a, uh, a blood workup done --n40530e recently or since you've been biking, to see if it,
67620:31	uh, but i just, you know, more or less stocked, like an exercise bike and that kind of thing., uh,
67623:16	so, i'm more or less out of shape now that i've been biking, i guess, this year for just a couple of weeks.
67643:3	or i'll sometimes come in the school.
67780:27	and the dog was being house sit --n401893, or dog sit --n4018aa, whatever, by some friends of mine down the street,
68148:38	they just, uh, started it again, too just late, or, within the past few years.
68173:145	but, uh, i, i myself am in favor of it, uh, particularly for, uh, well i think texas has a good, good law. uh, crimes, murders related with, uh, drugs or killing a policemen.
68193:96	uh, why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after they've mowed down a class yard full of kids or t-, or tried --n40166a to, or done their very, you know, given their best effort at --n4016b5 doing that --n4016c4.
68193:115	uh, why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after they've mowed down a class yard full of kids or t-, or tried --n40166a to, or done their very, you know, given their best effort at --n4016b5 doing that --n4016c4.
68202:3	or, uh, uh, j-, just for the sake of argument, i'm taking the, a con,
68224:43	and then, then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something.
68309:44	and maybe, now, i don't remember if this --n404b5a is texas or not, that --n404b79 has something about all drug dealers can be sentenced --n404ba8 to the death sentence.
68345:17	or p-, or is it proposed
68346:3	or is it passed.
68507:73	well wh-, do you think that, uh, consumer goods, goods are generally getting better, or worse in quality.
68546:11	so either you or your husband can be warm
68690:54	mumblex, they don't want anyone with exper-, anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system.
68703:60	if i were ar-, let's say i were arrested --n402380 falsely or not and put --n40239b up for a jury
68744:52	and, uh, it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much brow-, you know, browbeat the jury, a majority, in the, of the, a majority of the jury,
68760:30	and, uh, or, or, uh, if it's a corporation, that --n404308 was, uh, you know, har-, harming some individual or something like that, they get very much, well, you know, it's just a big faceless corp-, corporation.
68760:112	and, uh, or, or, uh, if it's a corporation, that --n404308 was, uh, you know, har-, harming some individual or something like that, they get very much, well, you know, it's just a big faceless corp-, corporation.
68809:19	and, uh, or they fool the, the defense in --n405673 thinking that they're, you know,
68816:53	they're not looking for someone who --n405bb1's going --n405bc0 to be the most reasoned or sensible or rational juror.
68816:57	they're not looking for someone who --n405bb1's going --n405bc0 to be the most reasoned or sensible or rational juror.
68972:52	i, you know, go to cleveland --n4014ef to see them play, the indians or the red sox,
68981:3	or,
69083:61	they really did throw away a lot of money --n403381 to get, getting one thing or another,
69104:48	so, my father was working down in los angeles for like, uh, six months or so,
69107:32	well, any time we had a school vacation or something like that --n403d92 we went down to los angeles,
69146:19	we've been two or three times and probably go back again this winter.
69352:3	or, uh,
69440:43	i had, i've had, uh, two or three drug tests that i had --n4004e7 to get --n4004f6 before i could start --n40050d working at a job uh, different jobs.
69484:26	like if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever, i mean, you can come to, come to work --n401799 drunk and get in an accident
69517:90	you know, secretaries aren't, aren't really going --n402000 to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something.
69520:32	and, so, i really don't care one way or another if anybody wants --n4022da to pull me up tomorrow and test me. because i have nothing to worry about --n402329.
69536:23	uh, you find out one way or another if somebody's got a problem on the job.
69541:82	and if, e-, even if, like you say, even if it's just the secretary, if her work or abilities start --n4029e6 affecting her co-workers then it, it's still a problem.
69635:50	so that they're sure that you haven't borrowed anybody's, i guess, or something.
69705:78	so, i guess if they perfect that mumblex is not quite as cumbersome as having --n405b69 to go --n405b78 fill a bottle or give blood or something like that.
69705:86	so, i guess if they perfect that mumblex is not quite as cumbersome as having --n405b69 to go --n405b78 fill a bottle or give blood or something like that.
69804:37	so they have --n401495 to start --n4014a4 talking about it, or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody, because they're rather socially active too.
70072:47	and i think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days.
70078:22	have y'all been having any heat waves or like the ninety degree,
70127:16	that's the second or third year in a row that we've had a real rainy spring --n402447.
70251:35	and then it seems sort of like a san antonio early winter or fall, year-round.
70255:53	so it seems like we only have two springs which --n4049fe is, or two seasons
70293:7	mumblex or east texas, is a little more humid.
70313:36	but if you want --n40592e to go --n40593d wind suffering or diving or swimming, you have --n405968 to wear a wet suit. and a thick wet suit at that, because it's just extremely cold
70313:41	but if you want --n40592e to go --n40593d wind suffering or diving or swimming, you have --n405968 to wear a wet suit. and a thick wet suit at that, because it's just extremely cold
70319:16	it's never humid or sticky or salty feeling,
70319:21	it's never humid or sticky or salty feeling,
70391:41	and there's a flash flood watch and, more rain for the next three or four days.
70468:40	do you have lot of, a big lot, or anything like that.
70569:30	i almost wish i was in an apartment or something. you know,
70576:3	or do you have --n131ba to talk for a certain amount of time.
70652:3	or, you know, i usually have gotten flowers coming out the gazoo,
70678:32	and i have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that,
70895:3	or was this just your own design of,
70908:13	our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked.
70937:67	so, i don't know if we, we did a good thing to buy a house or not
70957:37	and we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all,
70958:178	but it seems like there's, um, times when we just have --n40314f to get out --n403162 where we'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we'll go and we'll blow, you know, fifty, sixty dollars in one night going out --n4031e5 to eat, going to a show or doing something --n403214, you know.
70966:44	because we do find that we want --n4038b6 to go and do something or splurge for, you know, birthday for somebody
70967:3	or, you know, even we, we even do things real frugally for the kids,
70968:37	we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they don't know the difference at this age, you know, whether they're jordache new or whether they're, you know, something
70968:101	we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they don't know the difference at this age, you know, whether they're jordache new or whether they're, you know, something
70997:79	and something will come up and wind up having --n404863 to spend a thousand dollars, you know, on the car in two months or something,
71064:127	so. but we're trying --n405e75 to put a little money away for the kids because we can en-, envision the, uh, expenses for college already, you know, eighteen years away or whatever.
71114:29	lately, i guess, um, uh, or, at least for the last twenty years or so, i've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost, uh, defense items, at least in the last ten years, have been, uh,
71114:51	lately, i guess, um, uh, or, at least for the last twenty years or so, i've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost, uh, defense items, at least in the last ten years, have been, uh,
71190:3	or perhaps we have paid too much there,
71219:3	or is it all funded --n404cbf out of local taxes.
71279:125	and i, i don't really care what it takes --n4069e3 to qualify, whether you're, uh, an, an ex-, whether you're a veteran or whether you,
71281:3	or unless, uh, or, or you promise to even do something in the future, i think that, uh, the, that, that, the subsidy itself,
71282:3	or i guess the enactment of that form of legislation, would give many people who,
71322:10	in germany or in, in england in some cases people in my income level, at least, allege that they pay up to six-, fifty-five percent of their gross income in taxes.
71449:49	it has really nothing to do --n40140f with, uh, actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that,
71449:56	it has really nothing to do --n40140f with, uh, actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that,
71717:36	i don't know if you have had that problem there or not.
71894:104	but i feel guilty for --n40207f not going, because i really i'm, i'm so used to --n4020ca going for, you know, three or four years now.
71908:46	and, you know, working out six hours a day, usually six or seven days a week that kind of, kept us all in pretty good shape,.
71989:47	just, because yo-, you don't like --n403986 to or because, because you won't be able --n4039b9 to.
72175:60	i'm, i guess i probably put on about ten, nine or ten pounds, since i stopped --n407b7b playing, which --n407b8e was about four years ago.
72288:30	it's like something around sixty, sixty-five percent or so now.
72295:66	it seems like there's, it seems that there's a grass roots, um, effort or whatever going on
72300:44	and almost all the people that i clean for --n400eb5, believe it or not, are mothers that --n400ee4 don't work.
72341:89	you know, it's going --n4023fb to kind of kind of go along with the b m w in the driveway and, or in the garage or whatever.
72341:102	you know, it's going --n4023fb to kind of kind of go along with the b m w in the driveway and, or in the garage or whatever.
72345:28	um, and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever.
72352:13	believe it or not though the, all the women that --n4028b7 stay home are real busy when they are home --n4028e2.
72368:3	or is she going --n40301e to, go back to work.
72390:148	i, i see a difference in the generation of, even the generation before me, uh, were, you know, mom was like, um, mrs cleaver, uh, you know, june cleaver or whatever --n403881,
72437:44	the, the divorce rate keeps --n405016 hovering around fifty percent or so
72528:68	mostly, uh, something, i like like true life, not, uh, you know, documentaries or real stories about real people and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life.
72528:98	mostly, uh, something, i like like true life, not, uh, you know, documentaries or real stories about real people and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life.
72536:50	i like, uh, i like readers digest, believe it or not.
72550:45	uh, as far as like real novels, i haven't gotten into shakespeare or any of that type of thing.
72563:57	for some reason it seems --n400ca8 to interest me, like people that --n400ccb make a big comeback or, you know, orel hershiser, things like that.
72570:97	and, um, i like --n400e66 to read books on improve, like family, marriage, you know, things that --n400ead are written --n400ebc by like christian authors or, um, doctors about family and, you know, how to improve your home --n400f1b and all that kind of thing.
72605:40	uh, i think it was a romantic novel by danielle steel or one of those.
72627:45	a lot time is spent --n401fb0 doing things as far as the yard work or housework or, you know, that type of thing.
72627:50	a lot time is spent --n401fb0 doing things as far as the yard work or housework or, you know, that type of thing.
72646:93	i let papers, newspapers stack up and magazines stack up, if i don't really set aside a time to look or read them --n4026f8.
72683:22	have you ever read, uh, or heard of the book this present darkness.
72704:22	i'll stay up until two or three o'clock in the morning, you know, because i'm so engrossed in it
72721:28	i'm sure it's fast mumblex or something.
72730:16	i just sleep better or something.
72966:36	do you know how to use them in your life or to influence --n408385,
73015:51	a lot of people that --n4091f4 work for me that --n40920b can't even spell or read, you know.
73050:45	especially, you know, if you catch yourself --n40072d short on cash or if you're on vacation, it --n400760's just easier to put everything on a card.
73057:58	and, uh, i find if you're not careful you wind up, uh, a month or so, --n400964 staring those bills in the face
73101:115	we keep them, uh, we keep, uh, one gas card and, uh, and, uh, visa just, you know, in case there's an emergency or, something
73166:3	or they come --n4026eb get it.
73241:15	it was a visa or mastercard,
73287:108	uh, so, then a couple years ago i found, uh, a bank here in plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was --n404928, you can get a visa card --n40494b through them and no annual membership --n40496a.
73408:63	they had stayed with this family from the time these children were small, you know, four or five years old --n401579, up until they were well into grade school.
73474:74	there are those times when i think, gee, if i didn't have children i could be out --n402e81 playing bridge or golf --n402e98.
73481:123	i did, i had a friend that --n403099 said, you know, before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other
73481:128	i did, i had a friend that --n403099 said, you know, before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other
73489:59	it's a matter --n4037c0 not necessarily, uh, that she --n4037e3 might want --n4037f2 to stay home or he, as well,
73492:77	and, and, you know, multiplied --n403bd9 by the fact that you don't really trust the person or you're uncomfortable with the situation mumblex, as far as child care, um,
73520:26	they are not all things to all people or all children.
73629:3	or,
73659:91	is it, is it the one that --n4065ae needs, needs more supervision that --n4065cd has a bad influence on the older or more mature one.
73690:19	i didn't want a brother or sister.
73888:61	so, i'm trying --n4028d7 to think of anything else that --n4028f6's changed over the last ten or twenty years.
73900:8	and sooner or later there's going --n402c6e to, there's going --n402c89 to be a turn around.
73976:16	are you d a d or something up there.
73980:16	are you d a d or something.
74049:29	he used --n40509b to go back twice --n4050b2 or three times --n4050c5 a year, you know, because he missed it.
74056:3	or,
74244:49	if you don't have some kind of, of basic believe or something down inside of you, then it --n4030a3's very difficult to, uh, have anything to turn to --n4030e6, when you got, when you've got something facing you like that --n403125.
74280:75	and you can't make up in a classroom of one hour a day, what --n403a76's not been done --n403a8d for, fifteen or sixteen years at home,
74354:47	uh, not that i really think that they were perfect ten, twenty, or thirty years ago,
74434:43	i'm home at three o clock when the children are at home or where home --n406f1b,
74544:45	do youself have children wi-, who --n400aaf are --n400aba or have been --n400acd through the public school system.
74620:92	if we paid them more, it would attract more the, the higher educated people to, to either move into that field or to continue in that field.
74642:57	it, unfortunately, it's a, and it's a business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible as other ones --n40361d
74721:3	or.
74729:93	and it --n406031 was absolutely clear that if you could get your book adopted --n406064 by texas, then you had a built-in market because there were only about three or four textbooks in each subject
74742:45	and then the states that --n406515 either don't adopt on a state wide basis or don't have as many kids, just have --n406568 to follow along and take what texas gets --n40658f.
74896:12	it's more or less a spare room.
75021:8	um, or our breakers aren't, aren't powerful enough to take, to, to really help with the load in the house.
75059:6	lightning or something knocked it out
75061:22	and now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again.
75070:30	it's all new wiring up in the attic, or i guess crawl space,
75126:11	is it three or five,
75188:18	it didn't blow up or anything.
75196:18	she woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning, water dripping from hers.
75206:18	it shorted it out, or something.
75373:37	and now everybody, uh, has v c r --s and two or three v c r --s and that kind of thing.
75416:26	how was life different ten, twenty, or thirty years ago --n402523.
75445:52	these days they have these tiny little things that --n40304b are only about the size of two or three pencils
75447:58	and they have a little display screen that --n403191 shows you a message and either tells you a person or a, a phone number to respond to --n4031ec
75454:61	and they have the kind that --n4033ea just vibrates so you can shut them off, in a theatre or something
75478:42	uh, and they still didn't even know what --n403b9d caused it or anything.
75658:36	do you live in a real small town or, or out in the country.
75668:78	i live in a little suburb, uh, which --n401238 is, i guess --n401253 from dallas is twelve miles or so
75697:37	and since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or, you know, uh, burglar alarms uh, and including the out, uh, the outer perimeter type, uh, devices, sensors and things like that.
75857:33	well, you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something, right, and try --n4050a0 to get money from him
75880:7	you or the insurance companies never see any of that money.
75985:55	so, you know, people who --n4079bf don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever
76313:45	i don't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something un-, on, on top of the sand and then lay the bricks.
76318:67	but they have, they have a problem with these little tin-, like sand bugs or something that --n4054e7 drill in between all these bricks.
76344:74	but but it --n405d71 was an error to, to leave like an eighth of an inch or whatever.
76372:21	if it wasn't quite level or something, i'd just get that, rubber hammer and, uh, and, and prob-, you know,
76409:3	or what is it --n40737e that --n407389 will, uh,
76413:6	dursban or something like that.
76421:21	i think in this area or most all areas they use, you know, for ticks and fleas.
76447:110	i think, uh, you probably just need --n4080a0 to make sure that it dries, very, very careful-, uh, well, before she lets her cats out, or something, like that.
76507:42	i'm not sure if it's more a problem with american families or a problem with the school system.
76508:96	they seem --n4002dd to be burdening the school system more and more with problems, any problems that a child might have --n400330, whether it's actually a school related thing or not
76520:75	it's gotten way beyond teaching, uh, you know, teaching classes and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like, oh, were kind of traditionally the school's roles.
76530:72	uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day --n400f17 to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home.
76653:42	well, i, not to toot my own horn here or anything, but i, i was graduated --n4040d5 from my high school,
76687:3	or is he a problem child.
76699:90	if we see a child that we have any reason, that --n4051d2's on drugs, such as if he's got a beeper or if they're, if they're flashing lots of money around. we've, there are certain things to do --n40526d.
76731:61	and, so, i mean, you have --n405fe4 to find out whether there's a legitimate reason, or whether this is a warning signal.
76810:84	and, uh, it --n407b5c's too bad that all this stuff is just being thrown --n407b8f into a data base, and that none of the ideas or thoughts are being used --n407bd6 at all.
76871:3	or, you know, they,
76962:3	or,
77037:37	i, i've only talked to one or two
77055:58	but, i play in a couple of leagues and, and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend.
77160:37	an awful lot of people know where it is --n404b89, or have been there.
77325:3	or,
77404:32	this relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends, or something, you know.
77447:45	i think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff, stuff like that.
77447:55	i think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff, stuff like that.
77664:56	so our whole family, we take family trips to different places --n40193c to visit fish stores or go to fish shows,
77801:170	and you want --n40461d to be avail-, at least i've wanted --n40464c to be available, when they, for some reason, they had, they were bouncing something off of me --n4046b7. because it was something that --n4046d6 was bothering them or they were concerned about --n4046fd,
77810:14	or, or if my husband,
77821:28	you don't have grandparents --n404e77 near by or aunts and uncles.
77865:8	uh, or they didn't,
77873:25	so, uh, they never played together or anything.
78134:3	or if yo-, you have a break in the middle of the day, you take a coffee break you can always stay informed.
78142:170	um, i've found that when i, i don't have cable television anymore, uh, when i moved, went back to graduate school --n402448 i just didn't have the money to buy, ge-, rent a cable t v line, or whatever --n4024ab, you know.
78150:40	and uh, you could always catch a good news program at eight o'clock or nine o'clock on c n n.
78284:18	i can watch washington news or baltimore news
78307:57	but she also was, um, something like a, t-, uh, state auditor or something like that before this position.
78309:27	i guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the district of columbia, at washington.
78394:78	i've become very aware of different political views because some of the things we have --n408294 to discuss --n4082a3 are very politically motivated or whatever,
78494:33	but we've never really, uh, did any diving or anything.
78512:91	so any, any vacation that we go on --n401ed2 is usually, involves, close to the ocean, or, or something like that.
78555:35	are you a, you a hiker, or not.
78609:7	eleven or twelve, i would think --n403f2f, probably
78655:15	some-, or something like, uh, what's the, like the volkswagen vanagon.
78681:73	and he, uh, would like --n405b40 to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there, and just, you know, not, be settled anywhere,
78707:44	uh, but he's been known --n4062ac to be gone for a month or two at a time
78716:36	i haven't been in, in georgia or florida or mississippi or alabama.
78716:41	i haven't been in, in georgia or florida or mississippi or alabama.
78716:46	i haven't been in, in georgia or florida or mississippi or alabama.
78730:79	we took a trip, uh, around to the, uh, civil war battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something --n406e26,
78867:3	or,
78885:3	or more, uh, they're less apt --n401a37 to vote in programs that --n401a52 involve the government running things.
78951:19	or wasn't, or was that reagan.
78975:34	you know, i didn't know anything about bush or dukakis.
78977:102	so what do you think --n402eae about, uh, what do you think --n402ed5 about what you see --n402eec on t v about them, like in the news or on the ads,
79032:41	there's a few things where they have --n4041b0 to say yes or no --n4041cb, like abortion or gun control,
79032:57	there's a few things where they have --n4041b0 to say yes or no --n4041cb, like abortion or gun control,
79033:3	or let me see,
79071:21	like send stuff in the mail or have it at the library
79072:3	or,
79094:3	or,
79107:50	if, since you're what, democrat. then like your kids or whatever will follow you and just vote democrat,
79144:3	or like when, uh, gary hart was running --n406308, a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking,
79159:61	and then, i didn't think that was right, because he may have been a good president, or whatever.
79193:105	i, i think that doesn't really have that much --n406db2 to do with, um, unless they've done something really horrible, you know, or something real abnormal.
79198:12	well, criminal or something like that's different,
79226:143	but see they're trying --n407962 to find an excuse --n407979 not to deal with what, you know, the issues that people really want --n4079bc to know about --n4079cf, because on those issues you have --n4079f6 to say yes or no.
79227:23	and if they don't say yes or no, then maybe somebody --n407c0e will vote for them that --n407c29 wouldn't have if they had come down on the wrong side.
79279:17	so i was only fifteen or sixteen,
79429:54	there's needs --n402332 to be more public, uh, service of, programs or something that --n40237d would let us know had a happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what --n4023d4 is happening
79451:3	or, is there some reason not to --n402ab8,
79630:3	or, uh,
79675:26	quite a long time, uh, probably five or six years
79690:66	but now i think there are tests that --n401421 can be conducted --n401434, uh, to tell whether or not the puppies have the, have it.
79696:58	apparently they've been so in, well i don't know inbred --n40167e, or what,
79797:38	and he said, uh, a booster, uh, every year or two, i mean, maybe every six months or, or something like that
79797:76	and he said, uh, a booster, uh, every year or two, i mean, maybe every six months or, or something like that
79826:3	or does he just run out in the backyard.
79858:31	and is, um, stripper an inside --n4049f4 cat, or outside.
79881:3	or he'll bark --n405172 to go out
79938:3	or,
79944:41	and i think it's been probably about five and a half minutes or something.
79948:48	an, and, after, after about twelve minutes or something, the recording came on and said that was the end of the tape.
80087:77	there are times, when it's, when it's very useful --n401464, like, uh, emergency trip, or something.
80104:3	or you end up in deep trouble.
80139:3	or you end up, uh, --n40292b going in the deep end
80247:17	was it for health, or, to look good.
80260:42	because i'm not mumblex, i'm not big or anything,
80284:3	or do you enjoy, enjoy --n4019fa working out.
80414:44	but, uh, did you ever go to like one of those health clubs or anything.
80435:3	or i don't want --n4044ff to do anything.
80446:12	are you married or anything.
80555:69	oh, i wouldn't, i could just see hair start --n4068f6 growing out of my upper lip or something.
80682:39	and i'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them. either that or maybe rag rolling. to give it kind of a country look.
80782:52	well i was going --n4025d3 to ask if you planned --n4025ee to paint over it or try --n40260d to strip it.
81048:3	or, i, i, i also subscribe to something called world press, which --n4023c6 is a magazine that --n4023dd only talks about other, ex-, excerpts from the world press,
81053:30	it's not as slanted as the new york times or as biased perhaps as the local paper.
81070:14	are you from southern or northern california.
81126:3	or,
81171:123	i, i hear a lot of criticism about listening to these, the dan rathers of the world and, and listen-, and taking their word --n404511 for it, or their comment,
81207:17	do we get enough news or something like that.
81410:24	i've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times.
81517:130	the, yeah, that's the one i wanted --n404911 to see --n404920 where he was on, she was on a carnival, at a carnival on a ferris wheel or something --n404983.
81523:3	or did it come out in the,
81549:27	because we saw it, probably, four or five months ago.
81558:3	or a-,
81593:14	or, or who was it --n405ecd
81594:8	christopher reeve or mike douglas.
81609:13	and christopher reeve, or, mike douglas went after his throat, you dummy.
81625:33	and they marked off routes that they could go or something --n40683d.
81679:3	or, i want --n4077e1 to see it though.
81707:32	i think he's up in a attic, or some part of school.
81748:42	and a lot of times we'll go --n408b9c to rent a movie or something
81749:49	and, and you're not sure whether it will be any good or not
81778:25	she pretended --n409423 to be the boss or something.
81944:3	or you'll hit it
81953:37	i mean you've got a little place on one side or the other,
82193:64	well, see, they have that, um, what is it --n403204 a mumblex test, or something like that they call it --n403237.
82577:27	are, are you married, or...
82596:3	or my oldest is in school
82702:43	and yet she'd get --n402b4b to spend, you know, three or four days with...
82747:53	so, uh, i'm, i've lived here like eight years or so,
82862:3	or...
82977:29	well, you know, in the next year or so, you'll see so many instances where, you know, he'll mimic something that you've done --n407cb6 --n407cbd,
82982:71	and, and, you think, if i wasn't here he'd be learning that from a baby-sitter or from a day care.
82987:41	and i think a lot of people either, don't care, or don't realize it, you know.
82990:14	or, or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide.
83082:68	they hold it on the week-, no they hold it on a, either a saturday or a sunday, or at least a day when, when, uh, a great number of people are not working --n4012c4.
83082:80	they hold it on the week-, no they hold it on a, either a saturday or a sunday, or at least a day when, when, uh, a great number of people are not working --n4012c4.
83248:50	i mean, you know, you would take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever.
83248:57	i mean, you know, you would take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever.
83258:73	when i have heard about england's elections --n4055b8, they are allowed --n4055cf to run for what, a total of six or eight weeks. even for the higher offices in the, in the land.
83455:205	uh, i think that the judges should be left --n400a7d to do most of the sentencing, simply because, uh, there is always, uh, there is, there is always a jury that --n400b08 might be swayed --n400b1b, uh, by the moment, uh, to either to be too lenient or too vengeful, i guess --n400b7e.
83459:149	on the other hand, uh, attorney, uh, uh, justices are more apt --n400e96 to, uh, understand, you know, the cr-, the prison crowding problems and things like that, and have that sway their decisions one way or the other. you know.
83508:44	and, uh, only about, uh, f-, four or five percent of, uh,
83510:3	or less than, less than half the trials that --n4027f0 go to, uh, less than half the cases that --n40282b go to trial, uh, end up w-, with, uh, with the jury actually making the verdict.
83518:14	or, or most of the cases are plea bargained --n402bde anyway.
83525:3	or,
83534:27	most of it was, uh, robberies or things like that, you know,
83704:3	or maybe the evidence was not as sensational as the media presented it.
83774:78	so, uh, took it up there, towed it up there because it, you know, wouldn't start or anything
83825:58	so after --n402cef buying the filter and all the oil, you're looking at ten bucks at least, or somewhere in there
83845:40	how did you put that many miles on it, in, four or five years --n4035ae.
83905:30	and, and, uh, somehow or another they'll give you an option to leave a message
83940:43	i, i figured maybe i'd get one or two years out of it,
84000:35	it almost costs so much --n4070bd to fix anything or do anything with it, you're just better off --n407104 buying another car.
84047:3	or the plants do not make the winter time.
84050:191	and so i am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going --n400bbb to do --n400bca is we are just going --n400be9 to struggle through the rest of this year, probably through the fall too. and, uh, rip up, rip out all the rest of these junipers or anything that --n400c74 requires, uh, more care than i am willing to give the kids --n400cb7 and replace it with hollies.
84098:36	are you one of these, uh, howard garrett, organic enthusiasts or a, neil sperry, nuke the lawn with chemicals.
84289:15	right about the same time or after.
84306:48	and i just threw them on the side, intending --n405ae9 to transplant them or throw them away or something. and forgot about them through the whole winter.
84306:59	and i just threw them on the side, intending --n405ae9 to transplant them or throw them away or something. and forgot about them through the whole winter.
84362:25	but it --n406f5a has been about three or four years of, uh, uh, playing around with flowers to de-, decide which ones --n406fc5 actually grow here.
84402:124	the other thing to do --n40802a if you, re-, really like the hyacinths, and i do, is that before you plant those bulbs, stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them.
84406:37	i had bought these, uh, colossians celosias or whatever.
84467:25	and is sold --n408fb8 as purple buddy or sometimes sold --n408fd7 as straw flower.
84591:56	and this thing --n4020f6 came on where these, a group of like five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and, and robbing them --n402179.
84600:3	or.
84620:54	and were they, uh, were they, were they obviously poor or depri-, you know.
84644:31	i do not know what the world is --n40345e or is not --n403471.
84653:57	and he had, uh, he had not, uh, displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever, you know.
84653:62	and he had, uh, he had not, uh, displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever, you know.
84780:68	i mean, i, you know, i mean, i go to like an aerobics class or something.
84796:22	no matter who they are --n4068c0 or where they are at --n4068db, you know.
84819:49	i mean, in all the tourist brochures you read about what you should --n406fec or should not --n406fff do --n40700a.
85007:68	i mean, people that --n40a981 may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something.
85054:18	or the, or the jackets, the team like the raiders and the caps.
85120:97	it certainly does, because, uh, you know, the things in the books seem so dead to the kids, you know, unless they've actually been there or whatever,
85143:51	because if, uh, kids don't look up to you, or, or, ca-, can't feel they can spend time with you, they're going --n40239f to find someone else
85147:92	and uh, you know, nowadays there's a lot of people out there that you don't want your kid to, emulating --n4025b4 or whatever.
85276:31	and now they've located another one or la-, rather an expanding one in the northern hemisphere.
85279:65	i don't think it's involved --n401831 any longer with, with, uh, hair sprays or those th-,
85435:43	so we really don't know whether there's enough fossil fuel left or there isn't,
85664:16	get an extra bedroom or a basement.
85728:3	or the foundation is sinking or something. you know, just a little, just a little bit, some more than others.
85728:17	or the foundation is sinking or something. you know, just a little, just a little bit, some more than others.
85736:80	well, out here we, um, we live in what --n403b81 used --n403b8c to be, uh, like a prairie or whatever a natural, you know, natural grasslands.
85906:3	or, you know.
85973:53	i mean that was one thing --n40324b, that --n40325a came out of it, good or bad,
85977:40	i, i don't judge any war as good or bad,
85982:21	and i don't see any winners or losers,
86054:25	and they just really believe in allah, or god, or whatever.
86054:31	and they just really believe in allah, or god, or whatever.
86129:158	i think that the, the answer may lie in, uh, not in so much a, uh, national kind of medical thing that li-, like england has --n400568 but more of a, um, national insurance, uh, sort of clearinghouse or whatever.
86158:57	but for dependent coverage i'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars a, a month or something like that.
86173:3	or one of, whatever the type name is --n4020e8, h m o, uh, where the, uh, where you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest --n40217b. if you tried --n402192 to buy something like that, i'm prob-, it would probably be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something.
86173:210	or one of, whatever the type name is --n4020e8, h m o, uh, where the, uh, where you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest --n40217b. if you tried --n402192 to buy something like that, i'm prob-, it would probably be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something.
86259:83	you, you don't have --n404d6f to worry about --n404d82 filling out forms, uh, you know, for reimbursement and all or, you know, getting paid --n404dd9 eight percent of, of whatever.
86374:3	or,
86413:52	well we were there in the winter. in jan-, uh, january or february,
86499:26	and it's like ten dollars a day or something
86575:41	a lot of my travel has been sort of based --n404479 around conferences or business meetings
86665:45	and so i never --n4057a8, you know, got out by myself, or not much,
86671:25	actually i paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit,
86874:94	but, you know, any kind of handgun at all, if it will fit in a handgun and a rifle you would still have --n4027e8 to buy it, or sign up for it,
86950:15	but, the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized --n404024 because there is the criminal element.
86962:8	but sooner or later i need one.
86971:55	you don't have --n40466d to carry one in your car or your, uh, or your pocket all the time.
86995:35	no-, not that i have an arsenal or anything,
87041:33	but at least it was a b b gun not a twenty-two or a four ten or something
87041:42	but at least it was a b b gun not a twenty-two or a four ten or something
87112:21	are you, in washington d c or washington state.
87196:88	it seems anymore, uh, a movie can not be considered --n402c2e good unless there's just some, some sort of violence, or something in it.
87247:31	i do not know if you listen to him or not,
87287:3	or. i do not mean respons-, attachment and responsibility,
87424:3	or anyway it was, it was difficult.
87609:3	or if you, if you do buy it, it's extremely expensive.
87716:3	or is it always complicat-,
87739:34	although she, herself, had never really accepted jesus or gone through any of the other, uh, christian, uh, portions of, of the faith, repentance, baptisms, et cetera, et cetera. she had always felt a very strong, uh, leaning in this direction.
87740:53	and whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty-nine occurred --n40072f and most churches were either banned --n40074e or their, all the clergy and so forth were killed --n40078d or, or imprisoned --n4007b0 or, and the property confiscated --n4007db, she was safe because she had, you know, not officially joined the, the christian movement.
87740:107	and whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty-nine occurred --n40072f and most churches were either banned --n40074e or their, all the clergy and so forth were killed --n40078d or, or imprisoned --n4007b0 or, and the property confiscated --n4007db, she was safe because she had, you know, not officially joined the, the christian movement.
87772:88	and finally they, uh, carried her, uh, out into the courtyard to, to, either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of, of shooting her, uh, with by firing, or, you know, executing her by firing squad.
87772:158	and finally they, uh, carried her, uh, out into the courtyard to, to, either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of, of shooting her, uh, with by firing, or, you know, executing her by firing squad.
87815:27	and, uh, she was not persecuted --n4036ce or anything else like that.
87877:62	and, uh, because she could claim she was married, she could get, uh, an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in new york that --n404ab7 had a garden, an, an, an outside garden, which --n404b0a is very unusual there.
87919:36	and and when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever --n4058ed, uh, they did perfectly
87919:40	and and when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever --n4058ed, uh, they did perfectly
87942:318	i, i'm, uh, i think i'm, i think i'm, uh, a little out of the ordinary in that, that i, i, uh, i think i'm more worried about the deficit, the national deficit than, than, uh, a lot of other people are and think that we need --n4004e9 to, we need --n400504 to either raise our taxes or, or cutback on something
88038:32	you can't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it.
88039:26	if we had been like a chicago or a new york city or philadelphia or someone like that, and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and, uh, construction costs were cheap --n4034f0, you could afford it.
88039:37	if we had been like a chicago or a new york city or philadelphia or someone like that, and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and, uh, construction costs were cheap --n4034f0, you could afford it.
88039:42	if we had been like a chicago or a new york city or philadelphia or someone like that, and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and, uh, construction costs were cheap --n4034f0, you could afford it.
88108:57	we saw about them traveling to san francisco --n404f12 to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something.
88108:71	we saw about them traveling to san francisco --n404f12 to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something.
88204:100	because that, that just reminds me of, you know, like back in school and, you know, the girlfriends just taking off for a day or something. just getting in trouble and probably not that much trouble
88451:31	oh, well, it always balances out one way or the other once you get the whole story
88490:3	or he works in a, a movie th-, theater
88646:66	and, uh, when, when i was first here in, in dallas or in plano --n401877, um, and was finally able to, this is, oh, been like fourteen years ago we moved here --n4018de. and i was finally able --n4018fd to afford a new typewriter,
88687:32	well, i guess i have used it once or twice.
88724:38	i mean like going, um, forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing
88736:97	and you, and it does a lot of things too that if you, if you do any kind of, uh, research or anything like that where you have --n403be7 to, uh, use footnotes --n403c06, it is just wonderful. because it keeps track of all your footnotes.
88922:68	uh, i guess you have not reached the stage where you need --n40025f to, uh, promote a college or anything --n40028a, huh.
88968:11	was that local or, uh,
89008:3	or,
89020:3	or,
89089:3	or,
89101:13	after your master's or after your,
89125:3	or,
89224:3	or, well, that's good.
89234:162	so, there, there was one mother who, uh, --n4059ef came by right, even, before we started, who, who --n405a36 obviously was, uh, very interested in --n405a5d getting her, her daughter in or, or having gotten her daughter in or something
89234:181	so, there, there was one mother who, uh, --n4059ef came by right, even, before we started, who, who --n405a36 obviously was, uh, very interested in --n405a5d getting her, her daughter in or, or having gotten her daughter in or something
89239:149	but she was, her, her daughter was, uh, a, a, ma-, ma-, dru-, a majorette or something. you know, a baton twirler or something
89290:20	see i went about two or three weeks ago and saw f x two
89425:17	and, the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was, i was very well persuaded --n402cb9 to walk out. very well persuaded,
89472:46	and then, oh, let's see, there's a couple or three that i would like --n403cda to go --n403ce9 see --n403cf4 before they go into videos.
89574:61	i think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning, whether he is or not --n40616a.
89690:14	whatever you ask or scream --n40178a when i'm on the phone --n4017a9, the answer is no.
89756:75	i don't remember if he said it was sixty dollars a square foot, off the creek and eighty on the creek, or, if it was eighty and a hundred.
89785:3	or that's pretty much what it was built --n403594 for --n40359f.
89923:105	they, they show very well un-, they show very well unless you have, you know, lived in a lot of houses around the area, or looked at a lot of houses around here.
89972:27	have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that.
89978:92	and, and, uh, my father bought this, uh, my stepfather bought this --n400bcf thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care --n400c0e
90043:63	and, uh, he had apparently had not been in the home too long, just a week or so,
90213:76	he was, used --n4006f9 to be a reporter for, uh, i think --n400728, the new york times, or the washington post, one of the two,
90220:32	on i think it was --n400d84 romain drive or romain street or something, there in los angeles, they used to have a, or, i guess they still do, uh, had a, uh, uh, big warehouse kind of thing, which --n400e43 had offices
90220:39	on i think it was --n400d84 romain drive or romain street or something, there in los angeles, they used to have a, or, i guess they still do, uh, had a, uh, uh, big warehouse kind of thing, which --n400e43 had offices
90246:38	and, you know, it does not have a real story, or any plot,
90309:31	i thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years.
90435:52	but i have not been able --n406844 to yet, you know, for one reason or another.
90448:45	the sister-in-law in chicago usually sends me for my birthday or, or christmas or something will send me another, another good book
90448:53	the sister-in-law in chicago usually sends me for my birthday or, or christmas or something will send me another, another good book
90534:3	or is this something that maybe learning phonetics,
90647:28	and i'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem,
90727:39	and i have a problem when they compare the kids in japan or germany to the kids here --n4054a5.
90762:42	um, i, i was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they, where they said that, you know, these children, they, they had --n4063f7 to be the best --n40640e,
90794:79	well, and you don't, you don't see the parents, uh, encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or, drill teams or band,
90794:88	well, and you don't, you don't see the parents, uh, encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or, drill teams or band,
90815:3	or,
90872:12	is it choice or just business
90873:3	or,
90913:34	i mean, either way there was family reunion time, or not,
90943:3	or, you know, what we are left --n402467 with --n402472 is the, the relatives of, of, of that group.
90957:12	and or they were all in the same ar-, geographical location.
91003:128	and you know, we, we tend --n403dfc to try --n403e0b to do things, i think --n403e2e with our immediate family, as opposed to the extended family. of people that we may --n403e79 or may not --n403e8c remember or know --n403e9f, you know, very well.
91003:141	and you know, we, we tend --n403dfc to try --n403e0b to do things, i think --n403e2e with our immediate family, as opposed to the extended family. of people that we may --n403e79 or may not --n403e8c remember or know --n403e9f, you know, very well.
91063:73	in my, my, uh, father's family, we get together every year at a different location, either dallas or oklahoma city.
91064:123	they had chosen santa barbara, california for this summer and, and did not get enough people that --n40543b were willing --n40544a to go that far, because most of us live either in the midwest, or like in the texas, oklahoma area.
91185:89	but some of the, uh, the small, some of the larger small schools, you know, i guess around three or four thousand students have a, can offer a broader range of curriculums and things,
91190:3	or they don't have --n4020c6 to, uh, uh,
91239:28	would you, uh, advise a private school, or a public school,
91263:36	but i think you can get a good education at public or private
91264:39	but i think you can also get a bad education at public or private, you know,
91270:46	i, i think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for --n404439.
91286:57	yet, like, say, you know, the university of small town in arkansas or something, might have some top specialists in my area.
91293:35	yet, if i go to u of i or c m u or, you know, some, you know, any big name school, my quality of education might not be that much better,
91293:44	yet, if i go to u of i or c m u or, you know, some, you know, any big name school, my quality of education might not be that much better,
91304:3	or,
91356:57	you know, but then when i went, um, for graduate work, you know, or for a new job --n4062f2, people said to me, you know, shippensburg state,
91368:81	um,. i think it depends on if you want --n406725 to be a, if you want a regional job or a national job,
91369:19	you need that first, job or so out of school, too.
91469:72	and it was, um, it was called --n401011, um, smart women, i think. um, or something like that.
91634:73	because i, i think i was, i think i read it in college, or had --n40394c to write it, read it in high school or college,
91634:118	because i, i think i was, i think i read it in college, or had --n40394c to write it, read it in high school or college,
91686:57	when if, if i have long periods of time, like christmas vacation, or, you know, when i know i'm not going --n404694 to be doing anything for a while --n4046b7, um,
91704:105	i'm doing some reviews of books, --n404fb3 just to, what, to sort of recommend to wh-, whether or not a full-scale review should be done --n405032 for the journal,
91792:63	not only am, am i re-, reading it --n40699e to decide whether or not it should be reviewed --n4069c9, but also, um, because the board of advisers for this, um, journal doesn't have, right now doesn't have a really respected name, um, who --n406a64's a, uh, a scholar on, on music,
91801:40	i don't know if i want --n406fd2 to take that responsibility or not,
92169:77	and, and, uh, it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping --n40532b.
92173:38	have you, have you done this repetitively, or just once.
92205:69	we had, uh, the first reunion, or the first, you know, major reunion was probably six or seven years ago.
92223:8	two or three times a year you'll get a news bull-,
92225:3	or guess who our local sheriff,
92409:51	i would, i would spend all my time --n40372d in london, or most of my time,
92652:59	it looks like, it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things. where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show --n401304.
92707:24	so i like things like golden girls or cheers
92708:3	or, uh, monday night is real good with me, you know,
92791:30	they call it the night of the howling, or something like that,
92838:3	or is it hour.
92867:94	and, and, uh, i guess mostly i, i like the news shows --n405efd too, the news magazines, like sixty minutes or twenty, twenty or prime time live or something like that, you know, all, all of those shows, if i can do it,
92867:103	and, and, uh, i guess mostly i, i like the news shows --n405efd too, the news magazines, like sixty minutes or twenty, twenty or prime time live or something like that, you know, all, all of those shows, if i can do it,
92867:112	and, and, uh, i guess mostly i, i like the news shows --n405efd too, the news magazines, like sixty minutes or twenty, twenty or prime time live or something like that, you know, all, all of those shows, if i can do it,
92876:60	but my husband likes --n40623f to watch, um, old movies, especially war movies, or, or, uh, sports, which i'm not,
92902:3	or i may be sewing,
92905:3	or, you know, i always have, or letter writing,
92908:3	or i may be working around in the room somehow,
92947:36	or like at six thirty i'll watch wheel of fortune or something like that.
93019:124	and i, and that concerned me, that people were using it as a way to get rid --n4006d3 of things they just didn't want --n4006fa to set --n400709 at the curb or take to the dump --n400730,
93046:25	see, it have been like nineteen sixty-seven or sixty-eight, um,
93077:3	or was she doing it on her own,
93126:89	and i thought what are you complaining about --n402f1e, when you're only going --n402f3d to get picked --n402f50 up once a month, you know, or once a week --n402f87
93215:3	or, if she needed to wrap something for, needed, uh, sandwich paper or something, she'd use that.
93215:61	or, if she needed to wrap something for, needed, uh, sandwich paper or something, she'd use that.
93263:156	i, i wonder how, how you instill in people the necessity for doing just a little bit extra to, to make this whole thing work. i mean, the extra like washing out bottles and jars, or the extra of actually, uh, making sure that, uh, you take stuff over to, you know --n4052dc,
93446:3	or,
93477:34	and then once, about once every three or four years i try --n400c4a to get over to england, because i lived there for a while, some years back.
93546:68	you, i mean, you can be as busy as you want --n40208a to be, or as laid back as you want --n4020bd to be.
93548:3	or you can take part in the games that they have --n4022d1 going on.
93711:49	you may meet people, you know, thirty years older --n4054de than you, or younger,
93772:26	we were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore.
93867:26	but if it's like a social activity or a recreational activity, i don't mind
93918:3	or i'll just get nuts
93947:3	or are you,
94053:48	you can d-, have variety by --n40480c putting your feet higher or lower, by --n404833 putting your arms further apart or closer together, by --n404862 doing them real quick or real slow
94053:75	you can d-, have variety by --n40480c putting your feet higher or lower, by --n404833 putting your arms further apart or closer together, by --n404862 doing them real quick or real slow
94053:103	you can d-, have variety by --n40480c putting your feet higher or lower, by --n404833 putting your arms further apart or closer together, by --n404862 doing them real quick or real slow
94119:3	or, you know, it, it, it's always trade offs,
94164:132	well, i, i, i guess if i was having a dinner party i, depending on the number of people, i might cook a, like a brisket or a roast or a, maybe a chicken dish
94164:139	well, i, i, i guess if i was having a dinner party i, depending on the number of people, i might cook a, like a brisket or a roast or a, maybe a chicken dish
94302:19	well, get a towel or go --n402dbc change.
94336:3	or it's always good on top of something in the sandwich.
94421:3	or we bought the, the filets, and then the chicken, or turkey nuggets,
94421:46	or we bought the, the filets, and then the chicken, or turkey nuggets,
94497:68	and this has been going on at least, uh, i would say, at least twenty-five years or thirty, something like that.
94550:24	and then they have generally a show or an auction or something --n40145c on saturday night --n401473 to help --n401482 raise funds --n401495 to cover the costs of such.
94550:31	and then they have generally a show or an auction or something --n40145c on saturday night --n401473 to help --n401482 raise funds --n401495 to cover the costs of such.
94572:24	i think normal's about sixty or seventy.
94648:38	and i think we've been to one in thirty-five years or something like that,
94770:69	and again, it's not, it --n40506c's not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the meeting room down in the cabins and such,
94821:71	is it the, do you think it's the values that they're teaching --n40061f in school or the values they get --n400646 from home.
94823:23	uh, well, the values, more or less at home and the t v, just a general,
94839:180	i think too many parents expect, uh, the school to teach, uh, the moral aspects of, of things to the st-, to the kids and, you know, while we're not going --n401035 to worry about, uh, --n401054 teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that, you know, and then expect them to pick it up at school,
94839:198	i think too many parents expect, uh, the school to teach, uh, the moral aspects of, of things to the st-, to the kids and, you know, while we're not going --n401035 to worry about, uh, --n401054 teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that, you know, and then expect them to pick it up at school,
94853:37	you know, i wonder if that's a root problem or not,
94877:148	you look at the schools like that where you've got a lot of kids who --n402ada are basically, uh, that --n402afd might be more well to-, well off, you know, going to a private catholic school or whatever --n402b58, uh,
94994:144	uh, when my children were growing up --n400aa1, i actually had them, up and until they were in the preschool situation, i had them in a, in a home with a lady who --n400b28 kept two or three kids,
95254:54	and i couldn't just, you know, wait for eight, three or four months and then bring them back to her
95313:117	and he said, mom, i don't like that man, said, he took me by the head and dunked my head under the water and told me i had --n406eea to get my face wet or i'd never swim
95326:46	but she said, let's go ahead and send him another day, or two days,
95445:55	we use it more for just writing programs when we need --n401e39 to --n401e48 or, um, doing research, looking at the speech signal and then doing writing, and also as a just as a terminal,
95492:37	oh, that's a, an ambulance or something going on here, i think --n402e37.
95515:88	i can't talk on th-, can't do this much later than now, between sort of like six, five thirty and six thirty or something like that, because the traffic outside, they honk the horn so loud i can't even hear the phone call.
95529:65	and, um, what did, did you ever try --n403aa1 using like prodigy or any of those systems.
95551:3	or,
95601:41	do you think you d base is more flexible or allows you to do more.
95657:81	i, i especially agree that if it's an area where they could cause somebody else, you know harm or injury --n40099f, absolutely.
95724:37	but when you consider they could be driving an airplane or driving a bus, or a train --n401d86, um
95724:50	but when you consider they could be driving an airplane or driving a bus, or a train --n401d86, um
95749:37	and, and, you know, our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a, in a pool
95749:46	and, and, you know, our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a, in a pool
95787:14	either just the lucky or the unlucky one, depending on how you look at it --n402f59.
95811:43	and i guess you'd report that to a supervisor, maybe anonymously or something because i, i would feel very uncomfortable --n40399d working with someone i knew --n4039c0 was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol,
95811:125	and i guess you'd report that to a supervisor, maybe anonymously or something because i, i would feel very uncomfortable --n40399d working with someone i knew --n4039c0 was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol,
95813:7	personnel, or something,
95831:36	you know they couldn't hurt me with their ten key or something,
95853:89	and, and i'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims aren't due to, uh, illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse.
95876:34	they haven't ruled on whether they can test them or not.
95903:41	however, this isn't a problem that we have --n405a2d either alcohol or drug,
95915:62	and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much --n405f08 whether they're really concerned about their rights, or whether they're really concerned about something else.
95931:3	or do you have some,
96346:14	or, or if it's at the beach,
96400:66	and, uh, so we, we will usually rent one for about a week or so.
96457:72	and, uh, they have a, we have a, uh, i think it's three bedroom or two bedroom, uh, condominium, which --n40346d will sleep, i do not know, quite a few about, six or eight. and, uh, cause it's got, you know, pull out couches and all that,
96457:136	and, uh, they have a, we have a, uh, i think it's three bedroom or two bedroom, uh, condominium, which --n40346d will sleep, i do not know, quite a few about, six or eight. and, uh, cause it's got, you know, pull out couches and all that,
96485:40	we, in fact, we stayed an extra day or so, because we liked
96584:14	or, or what do you think --n400293.
96604:3	or have you,
96679:72	so, i was in a lot of classes where, uh, there, i was either the only girl or, you know, one of just a very, few women in the class --n401796.
96713:55	there was something on t v --n402049 the other day that --n402060 said that fewer than one or two percent of the heads of, uh, chairmen of the board, chair-, chair persons, uh, if you sa-, if you will, of the board are women in this country.
96814:49	i do-, i do not know if you are roman catholic or, you know, what --n403eaf you know --n403ebe about that.
96875:30	i do not know if he was a general or, you know, what his rank was --n4054b5,
96958:3	or,
96977:21	but i probably talked to seven or eight people.
97004:55	because, uh, i, i guess i placed all but one or two of my calls. and, uh, only because i going --n407510 to make some money,
97229:3	or we really do develop some health problems.
97285:36	i do not know what the healing process would be --n4033ad or what --n4033bc was causing the problem,
97363:28	only time will tell whether it's better or worse, than the way we grew up --n404887.
97501:39	and i think every woman ought --n406d02 to deal with it or, ought --n406d25 to at least be exposed --n406d40 to it,
97506:25	uh, we are not talking about strikes or things
97699:27	and she's just started that like yesterday or the day before,
97709:59	and i will probably be going back to work around january, whereas she will be about, eight or nine months old.
97740:14	is it your parents or your husband's parents.
97768:3	or you can set up your work program and your husband's so that one of you is there all the time.
97834:25	but like when she is a month or so --n405cdc, my sister-in-law has had lots and lots of experience dealing with baby-sitting for large families.
97843:112	and we cou-, might even be able --n405f42 to do it on a trade off basis. that i watch, their baby when they want --n405f91 to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever --n405fc0, or if she wants an afternoon off. even if she wants an afternoon just to work. uh, and not be bothered --n406033,
97843:120	and we cou-, might even be able --n405f42 to do it on a trade off basis. that i watch, their baby when they want --n405f91 to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever --n405fc0, or if she wants an afternoon off. even if she wants an afternoon just to work. uh, and not be bothered --n406033,
97843:130	and we cou-, might even be able --n405f42 to do it on a trade off basis. that i watch, their baby when they want --n405f91 to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever --n405fc0, or if she wants an afternoon off. even if she wants an afternoon just to work. uh, and not be bothered --n406033,
97866:130	but i think the whole, you know, ideally i think, uh, business should have the, day care centers there, whether it's the parents who --n406531 take turns --n406540 watching the kids, or whether
97875:42	and, uh, you know, parents come down --n4067ad to supervise or, whatever.
97884:143	and have, have some kind of real good program, set --n406908 up so that you, when you go --n40692f you can be assured that if there's an emergency that person in charge knows c p r or first aid
97888:77	or, and have some kind of program set --n406b9a up, like you say, to stimulate the kids, or educate them in some manner. and have the, you know, the right toys and the right setting and, uh, have, a, an organized type of program set --n406c5d up so that the kids have a schedule, you know,
98304:3	or,
98353:3	or,
98372:16	we will rent two or three movies on thursday
98373:34	and, uh, with luck, you'll have one or two that --n401c9c are good.
98408:3	or,
98654:14	or, or fathers are just missing, you know,
98655:49	so there's no, uh, no consistency there in the home or whatever.
98714:63	and, well, uh, since now i'm in my mid-forties, when i was in grad school --n402165 or when i was an undergraduate --n402184 growing up in a more rural area i thought, you know, crime was, was reasonably unknown and just the situation that --n4021ff's developed --n40220e with the, the drug aspect of, uh uh, the pushers, the dealers and the addicts, uh,
98771:31	and i think if i look back fifty or a hundred years i'd say, you know, back then there were the opium dens
98776:62	they let this person who --n403c3c had ruined it uh, become, well, die or whatever.
98807:37	but i never, i never heard results or anything like that,
98851:145	and i see, unfortunately, we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and, you know, there's a million dollars you can have --n4056a5 uh, for mental duress or whatever --n4056c8 --n4056cf.
98870:28	in this country, and for example with alcohol or with drugs is, we don't seem --n405d7d to understand how to handle it as a society to say okay, it is okay under these circumstances, but if you step outside these bounds, the punishment is extreme --n405e08.
98949:15	they can find guilt or innocence
98959:3	or even a panel of, of lawyers if, if it got to that point. might be better at than just regular civil people. not knowing, you know, exactly what things are --n400abf, from, from murder on up to like tax stuff, you know.
98968:82	and, uh, many matters are so complicated that it --n400fe3's so hard to, uh, come up with the fair value, uh, or the fair sentence
98969:88	and one thing that you get --n40114f if you have some expertise is, uh, you know the range of, of possible values or terms or, you know, how heinous was the crime --n4011ce.
98969:92	and one thing that you get --n40114f if you have some expertise is, uh, you know the range of, of possible values or terms or, you know, how heinous was the crime --n4011ce.
98974:28	when i only do something one, two or three times --n4013d9 i'm hardly an expert on it,
98975:26	and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three.
98980:76	and so how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was a, you know, worth five years or twenty-five --n40160a.
98995:12	or not long enough or, you know, whatever the case may be --n401f58.
99009:37	people can be paid --n4026a8 off or politically or whatever the case may be --n4026d3
99021:30	uh, and many of those get overturned --n402bb3 or get reduced --n402bc6 in terms of sentences, or get changed --n402bed by a judge or an appeals court
99021:56	uh, and many of those get overturned --n402bb3 or get reduced --n402bc6 in terms of sentences, or get changed --n402bed by a judge or an appeals court
99021:76	uh, and many of those get overturned --n402bb3 or get reduced --n402bc6 in terms of sentences, or get changed --n402bed by a judge or an appeals court
99026:26	and so, when, uh, you or i as an individual gets on a jury --n402de4 we tend --n402df3 to have certain mental images of what --n402e16's what because we see the headlines, uh,
99028:72	so we don't know what --n403076 is really going on, what --n403095 is, uh, really the range of sentences or awards that --n4030cc are, uh, are actually, uh, in the end applied --n403107.
99041:54	and, and, and the person that --n403852 was raped --n403861 or whatever doesn't,
99046:68	and they, they're put on --n403a0d like, they were the ones that --n403a30 caused it or whatever,
99062:45	if it's first degree rape, second deg-, degree rape or whatever, they only get --n4044f7 to decide on that,
99064:18	and you can decide guilt or innocence on that.
99068:61	uh, such like, maybe in murder they get --n40476c to choose whether it's, uh, premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees.
99068:68	uh, such like, maybe in murder they get --n40476c to choose whether it's, uh, premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees.
99075:72	but often juries hear only a fraction of the, of the story when they have --n404d64 to decide guilt or innocence --n404d7f.
99077:133	and to me, how can you, how can you make a decision if you don't have all of the evidence in front of, whether it be, whether it pertains to the case or not --n404f1f,
99148:77	well, what i wear --n40109c sometimes depends on, on how cold i think the school might be --n4010db or what room i might be in --n4010fe since i'm a sub, and have different rooms to go to --n401141. and always carry a sweater.
99161:55	you try --n401634 to layer, so you can add or, or or take off.
99180:110	and, and in the winter, you know, i just add a, maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than i do in the summer. and add a heavier jacket or, you know, wear jackets more --n4020d7 in the winter than i do in the summer.
99189:3	or they, you know, have, have spirit week that, that you wear your different outfits --n402605
99233:24	they put one on the parents, or the teachers and say they have --n40350a to, the men have --n403525 to wear ties
99247:24	i think the elementary school teachers, or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than, than some of the high school teachers, i think.
99282:3	or, there, there's, there's usually, yeah, there's usually something going on that, that, uh, and --n404b9b would, would, uh, cause that to happen
99289:80	and i, i don't know how a coach --n404e9b would feel if, that --n404ec2 teaches health or eng-, you know, english, or whatever --n404ef9 that they had --n404f0c to wear a tie.
99289:110	and i, i don't know how a coach --n404e9b would feel if, that --n404ec2 teaches health or eng-, you know, english, or whatever --n404ef9 that they had --n404f0c to wear a tie.
99294:26	they go around in their little coaching shorts or parachute pants.
99323:83	but, they, they don't look, you know, they don't wear their sweat pants or, or anything.
99369:72	i, i don't think we should be spending time --n406b8b saying somebody's wearing torn clothing or wearing sh-, too shorts, too short
99370:3	or they've got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high, you know,
99475:12	i visited once or twice.
99514:45	did you base it on what you wanted --n4019a4 to major in --n4019b7 or what you would feel comfortable with --n4019da or what you could afford --n4019f5
99514:70	did you base it on what you wanted --n4019a4 to major in --n4019b7 or what you would feel comfortable with --n4019da or what you could afford --n4019f5
99515:3	or, you know, there's all of these areas to look at --n401b59 in making the decision.
99525:67	and so they suggested that i might want a smaller school because i was used to a lot of one-on-one uh, or small group situations.
99698:44	normally we don't have too much, uh, humidity or, or, uh, rainy time when it's past june --n400db9.
99734:100	and, you know, so many times when you were trying --n4019cf to schedule outdoor activities --n4019e6, you just never knew if it was going --n401a11 to be a go or not because of the weather.
99865:30	i was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from, from the city limits
99949:28	and, you know, it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven
100042:46	even the couple of ice storms i've gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit.
100134:74	is, is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go --n40145e and they, weigh it or whatever --n401481
100153:31	you just have --n4019b7 to rinse out your bottles or whatever
100472:14	or, or was she kind of opposed to it.
100501:68	and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating very much or very balanced meals --n40184f.
100543:3	or probably in college station there wasn't a whole lot of choice.
100564:48	and, uh, you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that --n402afe share uh, a, uh, bathroom.
100613:27	and then if health or, or mental capacity deteriorates, they're able --n404074 to take the next steps without so much change
100890:40	and it, it seems in the last decade or two, um, that's true,
101184:58	and, uh, if we have children who --n4039b2 are not getting their education, for one reason or another, then what are we going --n4039fd to do --n403a0c with them.
101191:3	or are they going --n403d40 to be the thieves and the people in prison.
101422:121	and i'm really glad my kids had it because plano schools do so little of that. that if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going --n4018e2 to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff.
101422:125	and i'm really glad my kids had it because plano schools do so little of that. that if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going --n4018e2 to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff.
101436:33	and if you do you get them once a week or something, you know.
101494:17	was that in your home or in someone else's home.
101513:3	or did you have someone that --n403475 lived in with you.
101595:3	or they've, you know, whatever schedule they want --n404b2e from a pay standpoint.
101686:71	usually, you know, you'll find a, a woman that --n406497's keeping like six children or four to six children in the home
101913:26	i guess it's the texture, or something.
101946:147	um, and you can make a lot at one time when i needed --n4036e3 to make something to, uh, to give somebody --n40371a. you know, like, you know, to take --n40374d over to somebody's house or something else --n403774.
101970:14	so, or i give it to my mom and dad if i know we're not going --n403ea2 to eat,
101976:15	you can use chicken or turkey,
102122:39	and, and drink wise they have kool-aid, milk or water. normally.
102153:18	so, oh, year or so ago he found out
102220:49	that sounds like not as recent social changes --n400570, too, like back to the sixties or fifties, i guess --n4005af.
102347:36	they don't want --n403975 to stay home with the kids or something like that.
102374:67	is that, uh, is, is it like, uh, a preschool level then or through grade school or,
102374:77	is that, uh, is, is it like, uh, a preschool level then or through grade school or,
102437:3	or it's, it's a good change and, a good change from cooking and eating at home
102453:33	do you usually go out, uh, with the children or without them.
102464:49	sometimes i think we pay the baby-sitter as much as paying for their dinner or lunches
102497:53	of course, we like --n401857 to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers or something like that, too.
102497:58	of course, we like --n401857 to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers or something like that, too.
102519:19	oh, is it campari's or something.
102563:71	i think we're supposed --n402d2a to say what --n402d3d will bring us back to a restaurant or, or what --n402d70 attracts us to a restaurant.
102617:65	i mean it's wonderful, particularly if you have more than two people and you've got say four or something like that.
102655:14	uh, a waitress or waiter that --n404da4 waits the table, it --n404dbf's nice that they're attentive
102716:9	one or two times in my life i've ever had venison --n406316, i've loved it.
102873:33	and, i don't know who --n40240e was here or whether jay called a friend
102891:3	or it should be out on t v, i would think --n402b30,
103194:59	my in-laws also enjoy prime rib, when they've had some of their specials on sunday, monday, or tuesday night --n4024fe
103268:112	but, uh, during the week they often have, a, a limited menu choice but, uh, very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety-nine that --n4036a1 included the soup an-, or salad entrees and accompaniments and dessert
103332:12	but or s-,
103454:53	they do what they call --n406de0 a salad sampler which --n406df7 easily could feed two or three.
103566:30	the best answer, of course, would be solar or, uh, fusion, or something clean.
103566:44	the best answer, of course, would be solar or, uh, fusion, or something clean.
103715:237	one of the arguments, that really, i really actually have been kind of ambivalent about --n4006f3 it, but one of the arguments that --n40071e really, uh, made me feel kind of strongly against it, is that, uh, you know, someone said to me once, well, imagine if the person you love --n4007bd most in the world, like your mother or something, if someone killed her,
103744:26	he's already been either paroled --n401606, or whatever, for child molestation.
103752:86	i guess it's either, you know, put him in jail for the rest of his life, you know, or or capital punishment i guess. you know
103788:90	but you know i guess to some people it --n4022b7'd almost be better --n4022ce to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever
103897:48	well, i was, i saw on a human interest story, or whatever today, there was a woman who --n40503b was just being paroled --n405052 and trying --n405061 to make it back,
103929:112	it, it just appalls me that they can be out, you know, they even get a ten year sentence and be out in, in two, or three, or four years.
103929:118	it, it just appalls me that they can be out, you know, they even get a ten year sentence and be out in, in two, or three, or four years.
103930:153	you know, that's, that's scary because, you know, i'm not sure, i think we're paroling them without even knowing if they're, you know, going --n405f1b to be committing any more violent acts or not.
103941:88	but i know that especially with violent crimes where, you know, you're nearly a hundred percent convinced that they're guilty and without much repentance or anything else --n4064ff, you know, then, i don't know, i, i guess, i, i just really don't see much use for this guy in milwaukee, you know.
103953:91	well luckily it was for me. because they want, th-, they coordinate the times so it can, only be one or the other.
103969:46	well, maybe if they could, uh, if they had more money or more, more resources to work more on rehabilitation --n40780e,
103990:134	i guess i enjoy, i enjoy jazz, listening to jazz sometime although i don't feel like i have a good, g-, good understanding of it, or a good, a good feel for maybe what --n400816's good jazz and what --n400831's not,
104100:14	was it a boy or a girl.
104110:18	it's like elijah, or something like that.
104118:18	his middle name is chris, or christopher for for her daddy,
104172:34	well, i mean, but you didn't have oboe or something with it.
104214:48	so, um, i always think it's a nice break from the traditional organ or piano.
104221:3	or it --n403e14 makes an elegant wedding to have something else.
104255:40	does it, does it offer, like band, or some of the instruments.
104287:70	and, um, i don't, i don't know if he's really serious about it yet or not, you know,
104317:89	and, uh, it kind of makes me listen a little closer to, to the piano when i hear it at other places --n40604a, or when i, you know, see some, see and hear someone playing --n406091.
104325:3	or...
104342:42	and i couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was, was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were --n4007ea.
104373:17	and you got a nickel or dime, which in that time --n4019b2 was a lot of money, when you returned them --n4019e1.
104451:40	and i don't know if there's a deposit on those or not.
104459:53	they'd be, i don't know, maybe ten ounce or six ounce or ten ounce. sort of a small size, sort of a small size
104521:21	and it naturally, uh, composts or stores
104792:62	oh, that's the, that's the one where they burn down the house or something --n4046fa
104819:118	--ing seems --n40001a to be a, a topic that --n40003d's going --n40004c to probably take about a generation --n40006b --n400072 to, uh, catch on, it seems --n4000a1, or maybe a generation to two.
104833:67	so as far as at home use, uh, we'll pick up a six pack --n400a0c every once in a while or for whatever occasion of doctor pepper or something
104833:86	so as far as at home use, uh, we'll pick up a six pack --n400a0c every once in a while or for whatever occasion of doctor pepper or something
104835:34	at the time it was still, oh, about forty or fifty cents a pound,
104851:51	so occasionally i'll bring whatever --n4012b3 i've got --n4012c6 laying around the car or the like and throw them in there.
104944:17	the nickels, the dimes or what, i suppose it might be quarters, fifty cent pieces in these days, that they would get --n403dd7, they, the kids just don't seem --n403e0e to, to care that, that much about a small amount of money.
104981:41	and then once in a while i'll pick up a working woman or something and realize why i don't want --n4004d9 to re-, go back to work --n4004fc. what i enjoy --n400513 about staying home.
105066:52	and once in a while i buy that new magazine called first --n4021e4 on the newsstands or something like that.
105096:39	i always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we drive or wherever we,
105101:8	air travel or anything
105106:43	if i, if i go on an airplane ride or something, i'll stop in and pick up a, you know, a cosmopolitan or something to read --n403025 on the airplane.
105106:104	if i, if i go on an airplane ride or something, i'll stop in and pick up a, you know, a cosmopolitan or something to read --n403025 on the airplane.
105161:44	and how can a country stand --n400260 to, uh, spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem --n4002b3, uh,
105162:60	but, then that kind of thinking is also tempered --n4003ea with the, the knowledge, or at least the, the rumor, i'm not really sure if it's true or not, that, uh, we're not spending as much per, let's say --n4004a5, afflicted person on cancer.
105178:94	but, uh, i've heard it on more than one documentary that, uh, they were complaining that whoever --n400e06's sitting up there --n400e1d making these decisions or whatever institutions --n400e3c raise the money and, uh,
105217:3	or,
105229:106	and many of those things, uh, if they're not able --n40322c to, to be insured --n403253 then the country's going --n40326e to pay for it one way or the other. whether it's through prevention or, or treatment or, you know, just, uh, just helping the people when they are not able --n403319 to take care of themselves --n403334.
105229:143	and many of those things, uh, if they're not able --n40322c to, to be insured --n403253 then the country's going --n40326e to pay for it one way or the other. whether it's through prevention or, or treatment or, you know, just, uh, just helping the people when they are not able --n403319 to take care of themselves --n403334.
105229:151	and many of those things, uh, if they're not able --n40322c to, to be insured --n403253 then the country's going --n40326e to pay for it one way or the other. whether it's through prevention or, or treatment or, you know, just, uh, just helping the people when they are not able --n403319 to take care of themselves --n403334.
105233:19	it seems like one way or the other we're going --n403646 to end up --n403659 paying for it.
105245:83	but, the other thing that i thought of --n403bd4 on this is, i wonder if there isn't enough money, uh, in our economy or in our system.
105263:3	or you hear these, these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this, that or the other
105263:58	or you hear these, these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this, that or the other
105339:114	but, uh, in the long run, it seems to me, it's kind of like what they keep --n4023b9 talking --n4023c4 about the, uh, the aids testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that, you know,
105458:174	couple of guys, uh, restored an old wooden boat that --n40088b was built --n40089a back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real h-, big old four- foot center board that --n400905 went down in the middle --n400920 to keep you upright when the waves, or the wind came from the side --n400963
105461:58	it wasn't like the newer ones that --n400dc6 have nice chambers that --n400ddd keep it afloat or keep it, uh, upright again.
105465:58	--n4010db to learn the maneuvers you had to make --n401106 to work your way down a lake or work back up against the, the wind, as it were, --n401161 tacking back and forth
105467:18	and, uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing
105474:35	nowadays i don't think i could afford the boat or the time,
105478:3	or current,
105484:56	i, i don't know that i ever learned --n401dc8 to drive it or anything,
105487:54	they, they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever.
105500:23	i guess i was seven or eight years old
105553:133	maybe someday i'll, i'll get back to that as, after the kids are up and grown and the monies --n4047ff are there to get away for times on end, weekend or something --n404842.
105685:97	and, uh, it has just worked out really well with this, uh, position he's in --n4027fc. because i can go at a spur of the moment or what have --n40283b you
105689:35	and it --n4029b8 depends where he's going --n4029d3 whether or not i decide --n4029ee to go along
105815:80	and i think just the idea that you know that you may be tested --n400c42 might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're,
105877:86	also, i guess you can, you know, get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by --n40218f having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever, all kinds.
105877:103	also, i guess you can, you know, get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by --n40218f having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever, all kinds.
106004:3	or maybe it's under a health type program that --n404736 it it, it would catch a lot of things.
106061:3	or do you do it --n400b34 to give as gifts,
106062:3	or do you actually sell it.
106103:34	and he left it up to me if i worked or not.
106151:36	through a, uh, an adult ed, or strictly a china type,
106206:40	i eat differently than what i could eat --n40068b at home or around here.
106229:80	uh, there's two restaurants that i particularly like --n401075 that i, every time i get into texas --n4010a4 or i get into atlanta, georgia --n4010c7, i make sure i go --n4010ee,
106405:49	oh, i thought sometimes they say, you know this is three minutes or whatever.
106445:26	because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days --n1059d.
106445:33	because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days --n1059d.
106499:91	and that, the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days, and would have --n11778 to be hospitalized --n1178b a day or two,
106579:87	so. it --n1326e became dangerous for us to keep --n13291 transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair
106611:68	so, you know, you'd have --n400541 to hire someone if you needed --n400560 to paint inside your house or something
106631:58	and when i painted them --n400d2e, i didn't realize that we didn't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house.
106631:65	and when i painted them --n400d2e, i didn't realize that we didn't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house.
106753:24	did you have, uh, one coat or two.
106788:3	or have you done it before.
106806:20	we would go down two or three hours on the weekends,
106956:13	believe it or not, we did,
106986:61	and we intend --n403662 to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years, or next year probably.
106988:25	do you, um, buy from dealers or from individuals.
107022:8	my budget or philosophy, i guess, is spend as little as possible.
107053:97	and then at the end of the, of the period, pay period, if she has any left --n400fc0, that much is for fun or entertainment.
107064:38	you know, the accid-, the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that --n401508 weren't supposed --n40151b to be every month.
107064:47	you know, the accid-, the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that --n401508 weren't supposed --n40151b to be every month.
107105:3	or you get paid --n4020aa the last day or next to the last day.
107105:25	or you get paid --n4020aa the last day or next to the last day.
107126:3	or we are paying them off now.
107192:138	i, i started --n403fc9 subbing just --n403fd8 to go on a vacation and saved, all that money so because i knew that you couldn't, you know, spending, five thousand dollars on a vacation, or whatever.
107273:23	and we didn't buy really new or expensive cars.
107430:41	i don't know if it's done --n402991 by a private company or not.
107454:21	and sometimes you might have two or three.
107841:9	right or wrong i'm going --n401a31 to cast a ballot
107849:89	but they have been more, little more s-, effective in oklahoma with having this program that you vote --n401e27 or you lose it --n401e3e.
107871:41	uh, i'm not sure if i'm familiar with that, or not.
107880:57	and you don't have --n4027f1 to h-, be sick, out of town or anything.
107890:120	and sometimes it --n402b0d's nice to be able to go ahead of time and vote because, you know, if you're going --n402b70 to be tied up that day, uh, campaigning or whatever it might be. um, that kind of, just kind of takes that load off, you know,
107940:3	or, um, like we, i mean we've had those discussions, you know, about should we put her in or because she's pretty senile
107959:35	and, and all the other children are working or whatever.
107973:25	but it's only for like two or three hours at a time.
107989:3	or,
108039:28	and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever --n402fb9, i don't know what they're going --n402fe4 to do --n402ff3.
108054:95	i-, my fiancee and i both figure that's what's, we're going --n403774 to end up with --n40378b both of the parents or whoever.
108064:77	but i wonder how much, you know, if one of us is going --n403afe to have --n403b0d to quit work someday or retire early or something.
108064:85	but i wonder how much, you know, if one of us is going --n403afe to have --n403b0d to quit work someday or retire early or something.
108224:44	but then we're back to being warmer than normal this week, or last week,
108295:94	the, um, thing that, that --n40053d distinguishes me a lot of the time when i have --n40056c to dress real professionally for a meeting or something --n400597 is i wear a clerical collar and a suit and, uh, all of that sort of thing,
108299:58	but when i don't need --n4007f8 to dress up for a, a meeting or a service of some sort --n400837, i don't.
108435:42	we all kind of have our own little dress code of just either tennis shoes or little loafers and, and, uh, tights, and things that --n403e18 feel comfortable to us around our kids.
108514:82	i, i guess that is supposed --n400e10 to be put --n400e23 out at a time when i was growing up or whatever --n400e56.
108517:95	uh, i, i guess i like the shows that --n4010c6 really have a real sense of, uh, i don't know, honesty or sort of a purity value, i guess --n401131.
108597:46	so do you, do you have a favorite for the series or anything.
108876:46	so i decided it had --n400162 to be in it, --n40017d informal or not.
108877:61	you know if it's informal i'd probably choose something, i mean, just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill because that's a lot of fun, especially this time of year where it's so nice out --n4002eb.
108887:51	um, if it was formal i'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something.
108887:56	um, if it was formal i'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something.
108956:3	or,
108971:127	the one i had --n401e05 most recently was, was one that, was, ha-, she, she describes --n401e68 as jim beard's favorite, um, summer menu, or something,
109003:96	i find a lot of the cookbooks that, i don't know, that you buy --n4027ae over the counter ask for really strange ingredients, or things i don't keep --n4027f5 on hand all the time
109014:41	i don't have --n402b9d to run to the store to buy or look for something i haven't heard of --n402bec.
109132:25	spaghetti's a pretty staple every other week or so
109263:30	so depending on what your major is --n40174d, or medical, you might want --n401770 to atteck-, some, um, attend somewhere like tech
109324:31	i don't know if those are still available or not,
109504:42	i think that they would from the, you know, attention or whatever
109592:3	or do you feel there's just going --n403acb to be a big push to, uh you know, for, for more, more and more day care type situations.
109756:31	but we can do our part take an extra minute or two.
109764:99	oh, when we first were, were here --n402e96, it was like we'd take maybe a, oh, a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full,
109839:3	or do we,
109881:25	is it one you're renting or buying --n10255.
110038:110	but we're, we're kind of looking around and wanting --n12109 to move into a bigger home uh, hoping --n12134 to be able --n12147 to do that within a year or so
110067:3	or are you not planning on --n128ec having any,
110068:3	or,
110088:3	or,
110197:24	and that's just like a mile or two from our house
110327:3	or,
110346:184	i mean, but, i, i hate for them to make people --n4024e8 feel bad that --n4024fb have --n402506 to work, too, saying, you know, you should stay home, you know, otherwise your children aren't going --n402575 to, you know, turn out, or whatever because that's not fair to, you know, like the single moms that --n4025e0 have --n4025eb to work,
110350:3	or, if they wouldn't be able --n40294a to make ends meet not working or whatever,
110350:50	or, if they wouldn't be able --n40294a to make ends meet not working or whatever,
110391:68	well, and i think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as like job sharing or, you know, even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff,
110454:26	and they're not, um, high strung or over bred um.
110657:88	i just, i just don't think there's a place in our environment, you know in the work force for drugs, or alcohol either.
110659:25	well, i don't believe in drugs or alcohol,
110679:153	but --n400b91 not being a teacher, as you are, you know, i, i was not quite as sympathetic as, you know, as i probably would have been if, if kay were a teacher or something.
110722:3	or you don't.
110752:48	well, but why, if you're going --n402531 to do teachers or professionals, why not do the kids, when we see them --n40257c and they're, you know, under the influence --n4025ab.
110779:17	well do we agree, or unless it's not me.
110794:66	even though teachers have other kids lives in their hands, and if they come in --n403266 stoned or they come in --n403281 drunk
110930:97	we go from regular kind of spring clothes regular kind of fall clothes pregnant clothes, clothes that --n109a6 are in between where you're not down to regular size yet or you're on your way up from regular size --n10a05
110943:19	and they're all in boxes or bags,
110957:106	and when it's cold --n110bb, i'm wearing sweat pants, and most of, unless i'm going to something special that my daughter's doing --n1111e, or something like that,
110971:62	i just, i find i have --n11676 to get the right kinds, though, or it's not comfortable
111042:70	and it's just great because you can put, you know, you can decorate them up, or dress them up, if you want,
111046:3	or you can just wear them with, you know, tennis shoes if you want.
111059:79	if we, if we had professional jobs where we go into an office and have --n12dc8 to wear a jacket or something --n12de7 that would make a big difference.
111092:48	you've got --n13797 to have something to add --n137ba to it or something
111157:3	or if you get it dirty or whatever,
111157:23	or if you get it dirty or whatever,
111289:3	or just to face the children different directions or to do something
111289:28	or just to face the children different directions or to do something
111321:31	but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes
111626:16	she's about seven or eight years old.
111782:55	and so that night we had a reception for some of the, uh, potential high school students or college students,
111855:32	and my husband and i like --n400fa5 getting the salads or the lighter meals
111864:66	so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a wendy's, because it's all either mcdonald's or dairy queens,
111943:55	where do you go --n4028c2 if you like --n4028d5 to have a nice meal --n4028f0 out, or a big meal.
111953:18	and i'll order steak or steak and lobster combined
112029:3	or you go you know you fend for yourself.
112064:157	and, and, and i guess before i'd like --n400d78 to see that severe of a punishment for it it has --n400dab to be a, an absolute certainty you know, like, uh, caught at it, or something
112072:13	you know, or if they, they, uh, you know, severely beat up on a child, or, you know, i would have absolutely no problem at all you know, with, with,
112077:3	or they were abused --n40138c when they were little --n4013a3
112092:38	i don't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any deterrent ag-, uh, you know reason to not use capital punishment --n401947.
112117:59	well, she looked like my mother who --n4021b9 abused me when i was a child --n4021dc, or something, which i think --n402203 is, unfortunate for that person and yet shouldn't be an excuse.
112125:26	and i was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some miss america was abused --n4024c5 by the man she loved --n4024e4
112132:49	and i didn't, couldn't realize if it was the husband or the father or what,
112132:56	and i didn't, couldn't realize if it was the husband or the father or what,
112139:60	and yet, i mean, did you ever in your life when you were little --n402fcd know anybody or hear anything of anything like this.
112163:28	unless they're caught --n403788 in the act or the-, the-, the child is very badly, you know, beaten --n4037e3 up, it comes down to a one word against the other that type thing.
112187:17	killing a child, or kidnapping, uh,
112194:3	or like when, uh, i've heard when i,
112221:46	do you go like home cooking, like black-eyed pea and that kind of thing or cafeteria.
112249:65	um, there's a little place down on, what is that --n400bba. coit road, um, chinese pavilion or something.
112263:70	but our favorite when you have a little more to spend --n400fa0 --n400fa7, is to go to taiwan or may dragon.
112292:38	and he'll just eat chips until we've got three or four baskets coming back.
112322:27	in fact, you're about the third or fourth person in the last month that --n401f1e said that.
112347:54	now, my kids didn't like it because they just wanted --n40259a to get plain old spaghetti or lasagna,
112417:64	my husband was saying that up north they have such nice restaurants where you can go --n40362c after a theater or after the movie.
112636:68	and, and, uh, uh, but we didn't, uh, do it as much or as often as, uh, i would have liked --n401ad6 to.
112827:3	or do they stay at,
112866:22	what if you had a fire or something with babies.
112906:3	or is it just a job for them.
113018:37	if they'll take a group of kids to the zoo or somewhere and then come back and not even count them and realize they're one short.
113176:393	uh, my, my idea i guess of the ideal vacation would be to begin with, uh, money be no object. you know, so just absolutely, you know, first class fly where i want --n402ab2 to --n402ac1, rent a car if i want --n402ae4 to. uh, you know, just the, really the nicest hotels and stuff like that and and not worry if somebody says, well, let's take this little side trip, you know, and not have to sit there and figure out, um, you know, again we, we fit that in there or not.
113320:3	or i probably wouldn't have been there.
113354:72	and i used --n401d57 to tease my husband sometimes and say, my gosh yo-, did you bet the house or something this week --n401db2 to get so excited about, these games.
113393:16	and there's no mountains or anything, you know,
113429:79	in, in colorado when the broncos went to the superbowl three times in the last, i don't know, five or six years whatever it's been --n40355e --n403565. um, they have these songs on the radio.
113637:87	i think if card cards were as, as stringent as say a, a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have --n403339 to, you know, be able --n40335c to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills --n403397, we probably wouldn't have the problems we have --n4033ca.
113688:3	or,
113724:13	uh, fifteen or twenty i guess --n404743.
113821:3	or we'd all be in, in dire trouble.
113845:53	the biggest, you know, the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense.
113850:99	if they were --n4032dd to take half of what they spend --n403300 on that and put it on some economic, you know, inter-, intergovernmental or inter united states like programs that one really might.
113862:3	or it will just totally get even more out of control
113961:67	and the federal came in and said, hey, you know, you have either got --n401095 to build more prisons or let people go.
113966:144	and finally our governor at the time which who --n401273 is not in office now came in and said, okay, where we draw the line --n4012be is no sex offenders will be let --n4012e1 loose. under early bail, you know or early, uh get out.
114102:80	i don't know that it's ever been seriously considered --n40018b, uh, as far as close to passing, uh, any legislation or anything like that.
114239:118	and, uh, and i, i, i don't know what, what --n403c9b has, what --n403cb2 has set it off or what
114258:72	it --n10797's often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that.
114305:3	or,
114367:65	it --n12350's just very difficult to get a woman who --n1237f doesn't have a lot of assets or whatever out of china even temporarily --n123be to visit here.
114465:17	did you crack the block or what.
114724:53	i, i didn't, i didn't set the time or anything --n404cd3 to, uh,
114774:25	and just as we're preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings
114907:53	but they never say who, who they're really working for --n40369e or what, you know, what what, what questions are, you know,
114929:3	or,
115080:85	they'll come in and tell us that the switchboard is full now and it's time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that.
115163:53	on this, this thing that i'm, this survey or whatever, you know, this i volunteered for --n40297f.
115168:3	or do i wait for people to call me.
115194:3	or do i.
115375:45	oh, and this, this is more of a play or something that, that it was from --n400a1b, that, that i saw --n400a3a
115412:92	he wrote books that --n40153a were, like, pretty short and pretty easy to read --n401575, you know, like written at a third grade level or whatever.
115445:34	uh, this is when they were having their revolution or whatever --n401e42
115553:41	you want --n10034 to go ahead and tell me your favorite team, or who you think --n10077 will be doing well this year.
115588:11	and the mailman or karl malone was, you know, pretty big thing
115605:3	or they're not going --n1135c to have any of the team left --n1137f at all.
115730:6	whittling or,
115781:58	you don't, uh, you're not in-, into hacking or whatever.
115916:98	but, uh, there's, uh, some, some stuff that i want --n403c49 to do --n403c58 with like sierra club and go down to grand canyon or something like that.
115994:63	he needs his weekends free, or --n400ddf --n400de6 to be able --n400df9 to use it or a day during the week or something,
115994:79	he needs his weekends free, or --n400ddf --n400de6 to be able --n400df9 to use it or a day during the week or something,
116271:42	and it --n400d67's nice to know something doesn't work or something doesn't exist,
116286:60	and what they ran on --n4015f3 in platform don't necessarily come true in their voting in the senate or congress, whatever.
116314:89	i don't think the, you know, i don't think money is going --n4021c0 to take the place of intelligence or, uh, problem solving skills.
116535:3	or,
116760:45	because when you get married --n148ff --n14906, you won't have the money or the time.
116776:42	i, i mean i could have had that or a down payment on a new car
116883:98	now i, somehow i feel we're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen, you know, across the street, or seeing someone get mugged --n401e04, or unfortunately, raped --n401e1f,
116883:119	now i, somehow i feel we're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen, you know, across the street, or seeing someone get mugged --n401e04, or unfortunately, raped --n401e1f,
116906:55	well, i can see, you know, especially if you heard screams from a house or something, not going over there maybe, because, you know, it could be dangerous,
116923:70	and, if you see a situation that --n40305f looks like it could be trouble, just get out of it or call for help, whichever.
117113:36	so do you know of any other shows in the even, or something that you enjoy --n402890.
117171:43	well, i don't know if we've talked our full three minutes or not.
117330:61	it ended up i got some furniture --n4027cc back that one of them had moved --n4027ef out or something.
117429:39	so you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute.
117490:28	i don't know if i believe that or not,
117511:64	the herald is owned --n4010ef, i think --n401106, by the times out of, uh, l a, or somewhere.
117518:16	or d-, or do they,
117585:3	or is it --n40251d enough just to have a thing that --n402544 makes loud noise.
117592:58	but, uh, this deal --n40279a that was part of it for, you know, three years or so to pay the unit off or whatever.
117592:79	but, uh, this deal --n40279a that was part of it for, you know, three years or so to pay the unit off or whatever.
117602:33	several times you'll hit the wrong key, not intentionally or something
117640:14	or, or not here,
117775:193	one of the things i've noticed --n400fd1 is, one of the trends i've, i've noticed --n40101c is that, uh, it --n40103f's always too easy to just plop your kids down in front of the t v and let them watch movies or, or play video games or something.
117775:206	one of the things i've noticed --n400fd1 is, one of the trends i've, i've noticed --n40101c is that, uh, it --n40103f's always too easy to just plop your kids down in front of the t v and let them watch movies or, or play video games or something.
117836:3	or uh, you know, you got some cartoons
117883:91	but, uh, we, we still, uh, oh, like --n4037b8 to pack up, you know, just go someplace for the day or, uh, you know, just stuff like that.
117912:79	i, i think, our kids just always dearly loved that, you know, play bounce the ball, or just, uh,
117936:99	it's, it's so different down here where y-, you go --n404a88 take lessons --n404a97 to learn --n404aa6 to ice skate or something --n404ac1.
117982:68	and there's nothing you could say --n400aac bad about him, except that i was more of a cat or a small dog --n400af3 person that you could sit --n400b0e in the chair and cuddle --n400b29.
118023:57	and i told my husband --n401b97, i said --n401baa, you know, it's either me or the dog,
118109:33	she must have known he didn't like her or something.
118111:10	or the smell or something.
118289:8	salt water or,
118424:62	and altog-, all total, it --n4026a4 was just under two hundred dollars, believe it or not, to get all that done --n4026f7.
118494:11	uh, fortunately or unfortunately it doesn't go into effect because we did not get the united airlines.
118576:7	no loopholes or anything.
118577:15	everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or whatever.
118577:19	everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or whatever.
118586:69	no big elaborate laws that --n402241 say, uh, you know, call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review.
118620:3	or you come down to the end of the year
118743:60	and you know, we'll just have --n401878 to wait and see whether that's approved --n40189f or not.
118849:15	like for two months or something,
118967:8	either that or i don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now, or what the, what the,
118967:69	either that or i don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now, or what the, what the,
118989:29	that must have been at least fifty years ago or more,
119077:46	he, um, had her in the car in front of a taco mumblex or something
119166:90	well, um, i was speaking with a, a woman from, i believe she was --n401d82 from the honduras or guatemala, or somewhere in there,
119166:97	well, um, i was speaking with a, a woman from, i believe she was --n401d82 from the honduras or guatemala, or somewhere in there,
119232:80	i'm not, you know, i have a problem, uh, with whether it's going --n403013 to work or not, you know,
119300:32	i'll probably always have a place here in richardson or dallas.
119524:48	always want --n4043bc to go to canada canada to banff or somewhere like that.
119572:54	i said, well, i can tell them how to fish with a minnow --n40075d or how to fish with a worm --n400784.
119612:30	uh, there's a lake like maybe two or three miles from here,
119672:89	and i, well, i can't think of a time that i've been fishing --n4028a9 that i haven't run into one or two of them --n4028dc.
119704:25	it was probably four inches in diameter or something like that you know.
119746:21	we've never entered a tournament or anything.
119800:84	and i also, you know, usually have, have checked over things, you know, if it's like an appliance or something --n4008cc to make sure, uh, it has the features --n400903 in it that i want --n40091e.
119921:34	i don't know if they're making them better or not,
120009:68	and there really is a lot we could be doing --n401bf7 stateside without, uh, --n401c12 hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations i think --n401c49,
120037:72	i don't understand, too, why we have --n4028b2 to have democrats and republicans --n4028cd, and it's either one way or the other,
120043:3	or you do it that way,
120047:15	you're either liberal or you're conservative,
120054:90	there's just too many issues that --n4030cd come up that, uh, our senators and our congressmen vote on --n403108 simply because it's a democratic issue or it's a republican issue
120176:23	uh, newspaper. t v news, or what.
120380:16	is that silk screening, or,
120442:52	you just get a book that --n4016ae tells you how to do it --n4016d1 or what.
120517:3	or do some of them play the same song.
120532:91	i usually get them for christmas gifts or, and like when people go, you know, to, on trips --n4031cb or something.
120571:3	or was that a college thing.
120579:20	everything was like an hour or two hours at the louvre, you know, things like that where you need the whole day --n40411b,
120608:3	or,
120725:45	they um, ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad --n4019a6 and try --n4019b5 to perfume them,
120761:31	um, do you like big dogs or or little dogs.
120770:23	and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had --n4027e9 to lift him and carry him every place he went --n40281c --n402823.
120851:76	well, um, i have gone to girl's camp a few times, as a, you know, a chaperon or a leader, whatever
120949:44	now is there anything, uh, are there any mountains or big rocks a person could hike --n402cc5 around this area.
121100:87	and the next spring, i guess --n401980 in that march, every time we would go out and just try --n4019bf to walk on the grass or reach down --n4019e6 to pull a weed --n4019fd, we'd have big whole patches come up.
121153:47	so that's the number one thing we do --n40298d, whether we fertilize or anything else, just because we got burned --n4029c8 so badly before.
121161:13	two years ago, or last christmas
121188:35	it's what they've done --n403214 in the spring or the fall.
121244:63	and i said, you know, you need --n404105 to either read neal sperry's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery, because lot of places that --n404160 would, are just trying --n40417b to sell whatever --n40418e --n404195 was pretty out there,
121355:48	and any time there's, there is a budget cut or crunches --n401372, it's always the small guy that, that --n4013a1 gets hurt.
121371:3	or,
121375:119	i just, you know, i, i don't know what kind of, uh, i don't know what, what level, or what, how long it will take --n401bee for, you know, our country to start, the public in general to start --n401c35 saying, hey, this is too much.
121385:61	i mean, right now we're getting taxed --n402543 probably, probably around thirty-five percent, or more.
121412:36	but then they'll raise it --n402ff4 somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever.
121412:46	but then they'll raise it --n402ff4 somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever.
121412:53	but then they'll raise it --n402ff4 somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever.
121584:17	just for a brief visit or whatever, because it never has been resolved --n402aae with palmer remarrying, and everything,
121641:28	i don't know if you know her or not.
121760:25	say if it was like greek night or something um, maybe, um, on the barbecue we'd put, uh, cubes of lamb or i guess lamb used for greek. and, um, like a shish kabob, and, um, mushrooms and tomatoes and onions
121760:80	say if it was like greek night or something um, maybe, um, on the barbecue we'd put, uh, cubes of lamb or i guess lamb used for greek. and, um, like a shish kabob, and, um, mushrooms and tomatoes and onions
121775:54	um, maybe some rolls and, um, i guess --n401230 some, uh, some rice or something like that.
121916:20	and get the recipe from them or whatever.
121988:3	or our jails would not be so full.
122120:22	and of course uh, of battery or assault or, that is not a capital crime see.
122120:26	and of course uh, of battery or assault or, that is not a capital crime see.
122138:110	um, huh. well, i don't like it when, uh, people listen to my phone conversations, like if they're outside my door while i'm talking in my room --n40018f, or when people like look through my things in my bedroom --n4001c6.
122265:57	and, and when you're on a conversation --n401e83 instead of --n401e92 walking off or just making themselves busy, they'll stand there and listen to what you say --n401ee1 until you hang up.
122269:46	this lady does that to me at work when i'm taking an order or something --n40211c,
122293:28	well, occasionally we'll have a person here or there, but not, not as many as the phone calls, you know,
122354:38	and every time a, a fire truck or anything went down the road --n4038df, i would wake up,
122481:3	or, you know, they'd start --n401c58 recognizing people.
122484:34	they knew, they knew the extras or the,
122735:37	and the other schools were built --n4037e9 back in maybe the fifties or early sixties
122746:38	and it's probably fifty, sixty years old or, or better
122789:26	uh, i was down at about four or five quite awhile ago.
122798:42	i don't know if it's just because i like the game or i just like --n400e05 to, to see the warm weather.
122805:19	but there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play --n4010d9,
122807:25	so. i get out there one way or the other.
122836:54	and i-, inevitably one facet of my game isn't working at one time or another.
122838:3	or i'm not hitting long irons very well
122839:3	or i'm not putting well
122848:3	or something would go wrong
122921:24	we used --n403508 to get four or five inches a year.
122981:3	or right now
122984:94	well, i know if they make the advances that they have been making --n400d59, that, uh, maybe age will no longer, age or even physical, uh, abilities may not be, uh, a barrier anymore.
123081:69	and i, i'd love --n403233 to be the first one --n403252 to step on a planet or some like, you know,
123090:99	i think, uh, it --n40358d's in everyone's nature to some degree to want --n4035c0 to get out and explore something they haven't --n4035f3, or experience something, you know, indifferent.
123103:26	a better place to be --n403ab4 or whatever, you know
123133:41	and, you know, just because they don't talk about it or something like that.
123169:3	or are you talking about others.
123177:177	our, our, our senate and congress and, and people that, that --n40096f deal everyday and, and what's --n400992 going --n40099d to be done --n4009b0 with those monies um, and don't really understand what that is --n4009eb or how a budget even works --n400a0a.
123185:3	or...
123226:33	um, you know, th-, or they tack on this, uh, pork bellies and, and do things that, that --n4017c9 are good for their area --n4017e4 to pass something that --n4017fb is, that --n40180e is not good for the country.
123242:35	i, i think that any company or anything that --n401ef1 wants --n401efc to contribute to a fund should be able --n401f23 to do that, and be registered --n401f46 with what they ever contribute --n401f61.
123348:53	and is it your expectation that that would raise the total revenues collected or, or lower them or what.
123348:64	and is it your expectation that that would raise the total revenues collected or, or lower them or what.
123350:27	i don't know that it would or wouldn't.
123419:12	and some paper or something in the super dome up in the roof caught on fire.
123561:35	i've never been a big saints fan until the last year or two
123608:48	i think they are supposed --n404202 to put two in by either next year or the year after.
123645:19	well, for the past week or two it's been cold and wet
123672:38	somebody said, you know, you're either a stranger or a fool --n400e29 to try --n400e38 to predict texas weather,
123955:3	or,
124095:3	or should i start.
124180:43	and, um, seems like a people just don't, or also don't have any family around.
124212:97	and, and, um, uh, the landscape is much different --n402f96 here in texas than it is, you know, in the north. um, or even where you are --n402ff5.
124269:46	i, i know that the amount of, or how far your dollar goes --n4002d1 probably more than anything has, has greatly changed.
124446:40	well, that isn't a, a true false or right or wrong test here.
124446:45	well, that isn't a, a true false or right or wrong test here.
124492:25	there's was twins --n400f59 there, or, you know skip williams.
124521:4	or rather they adopted me, i guess --n401c3d
124597:121	and it --n40366a's just incredible to think that there's, uh, there are players who --n4036b1 are the sons of ball players that --n4036d4 used --n4036df to play against nolan or with nolan, you know,
124637:50	but nolan i think --n4042f5 took himself out after a couple of innings --n40431c or something, you know, of the game
124658:85	it --n400920's hard to put the finger on, uh, what --n400957's worse, you know, the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion, um, with, uh, your hydrocarbons, uh causing the damage in which,
124822:11	in what major or what year.
124864:3	or you want --n400de6 to pick up a second major,
124908:14	and, or if you ran into them in the student union or whatever, you know, you could sit down, talk to them about a problem.
124908:46	and, or if you ran into them in the student union or whatever, you know, you could sit down, talk to them about a problem.
124934:3	or should i know you.
124944:3	or.
125017:3	or.
125102:3	or.
125158:87	and, and if i can get one that --n402838'll keep my limit at five hundred and i can never go over that or something like that, then that's fine,
125196:22	other than, you use them or you don't use them. you like them or you don't like them.
125196:51	other than, you use them or you don't use them. you like them or you don't like them.
125273:30	it doesn't have the coup de ville --n400bdf or the sedan de ville --n400bfa squareness.
125370:17	has that been the cutlass or the sierra.
125569:3	or which,
125646:83	and, um, i think it --n400564 was really hard to, um, to pick the right, uh, day care or preschool or mother's day out.
125646:88	and, um, i think it --n400564 was really hard to, um, to pick the right, uh, day care or preschool or mother's day out.
125651:119	um, some of the qualifications that i look for --n4007c2 was that, uh, you know, the cost, and, um, exactly what they did --n400815, if it was structured or nonstructured, if they had a little academic, um, uh, in there, and, um, you know, um, you know, what the qualifications of the teachers' were --n4008c4, and if the place was clean and um, the hours
125672:36	and i don't know if i'll be doing that or what we're going --n4011ab to do --n4011ba.
125738:91	and sometimes you even consider, um, you know, --n402c82 having a private person come to your own home when they're real little --n402cc1 or or something like that,
125752:14	and, or do they just put any child in any crib you know,
125849:15	once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if he, um, someone invites him to lunch, he'll, he'll not go,
125849:34	once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if he, um, someone invites him to lunch, he'll, he'll not go,
125969:9	fix or repair daily or find them re-, road dead.
125969:16	fix or repair daily or find them re-, road dead.
125982:22	my electrical system shorted out like two or three times,
126013:42	and, you know, when you work nine to five, or eight to five --n401a47, and you're in rush hour traffic to and from work, unfortunately --n401a86.
126054:57	my dad's always cosigned on, on my, my loans, or whatever,
126057:61	i got my mustang this time was by myself, because i got on my own, or whatever,
126059:61	they, they said it had --n4032fe to be like a first time buyer's car or whatever,
126068:50	, i mean, i got in eighty-seven, i guess, in like november or something like that,
126099:53	and if you try --n404724 to take anybody, you know, go to the show or go out for supper, and you go as a foursome,
126107:3	or are you a spectator.
126163:25	and if it's going over water or something one of them have --n401766 to take the shot for me because i'm,
126179:58	i'm going --n401e7f to do it right, and see if i can actually play this game or not.
126181:113	well, that i, i guess that's what i need --n401fdf to do --n401fee is, is get some kind of lessons or something.
126200:33	see how it's going --n40297a to break or whatever --n402991.
126222:72	i have, i can gi-, get it within like, you know, four or five feet or something
126222:78	i have, i can gi-, get it within like, you know, four or five feet or something
126265:70	well, it, it, it usually takes me about probably two, two or three --n403fb3 to get it there
126268:20	uh, uh, maybe one or two putts.
126305:39	i'm, i'm usually in the eighties or nineties
126314:48	well, i either, --n404e27 teeing off i either slice it or i hook it ever single time
126334:69	all, sorts of hours calling and telling me that i want investment advise and i want this service and that service or the other thing.
126348:129	i guess in some cases they just consider --n4006ba pickup your, your phone and, and, and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not.
126359:33	no nine hundred numbers can be dialed --n400db1 from my phone or received --n400dcc.
126430:3	or are they just calling a number that --n402329 happens --n402334 to be yours.
126475:105	and you've got, uh, all kinds of people knocking on your door and, who --n403268 want --n403273 to, uh, either direct you to the right path or, or want --n4032b6 to, uh, sell you, uh, paper routes, uh, whatever,
126536:22	people must be tired of it or something.
126669:35	we were going to a football playoff game --n402d77 a week or so ago which we lost --n402d9e
126784:28	or, or switc-, or overloads
126911:45	now, that's one i have watched --n116b9, oh, six or eight times.
127029:3	or i shouldn't say suit, but coat and tie every day.
127087:14	so, or, i guess,
127088:42	do you have things like presentations --n400ea1 --n400eac to do --n400ebb or anything like that.
127097:19	but, probably once a month or so, there was some reason that i would have --n40113b to put on a suit --n401156. for a customer presentation or something.
127097:85	but, probably once a month or so, there was some reason that i would have --n40113b to put on a suit --n401156. for a customer presentation or something.
127119:72	it, it seems like t i is pretty cut and dried with two, like, two or three levels.
127128:73	i would, if you, if i want --n4019b5 to say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like i used --n4019fc to be in that research
127128:86	i would, if you, if i want --n4019b5 to say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like i used --n4019fc to be in that research
127140:45	and then there's kind of the, the branch manager level or marketing people that --n401cd5 kind of do that middle thing.
127268:11	or a population or anything,
127286:71	i know a lot of their, oh, their countries that they had overtaken --n4015b9 --n4015c0, or wanted --n4015d3 to be independent or several of them, right,
127286:90	i know a lot of their, oh, their countries that they had overtaken --n4015b9 --n4015c0, or wanted --n4015d3 to be independent or several of them, right,
127327:49	i wonder how they're going --n4021c0 to get through the winter. food wise or any wise --n4021f3,
127331:40	sounds to me like they'll start --n4022ec rioting soon, or not that that would do any good,
127377:3	or is it --n40346d just coincidence it was during this period.
127492:21	do you do it at home or a club
127493:3	or,
127498:3	or a lot of times we're, we're up at the church
127532:70	by the time i get home --n401b1a, all i want --n401b35 to do --n401b44 is just collapse or sit down at my computer
127542:25	uh, do you ever ride a bike or anything like that.
127545:21	and i'd ride about two or three miles a day,
127555:91	and no matter what the weather is --n4023c2 they can walk at a pretty good clip and, and not have --n4023fd to worry about the weather summer or winter.
127562:19	i'll be in town or something
127662:3	or do you.
127793:67	and it goes into all the movies, --n402e8e previewing the movies that --n402ea5 are going --n402eb4 to be released --n402ec7 or behind the scenes.
127993:3	or,
128077:3	or,
128104:83	i mean, they'll have some things --n40312a in there that --n40313d almost, almost, you know, like supernatural, or something, you know,
128108:3	or, i mean, it sounds weird,
128284:40	well, do you watch any, uh any sports or anything like that
128290:3	or,
128305:35	occasionally, some ice skating will come on, on a sunday or during the olympics
128452:34	within reason, you know, you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical being
128488:3	or you don't have time or something like that.
128488:20	or you don't have time or something like that.
128489:81	but if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning, just like brushing your teeth you're going --n4039ec to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour.
128506:3	or,
128512:74	it's a, like it's something you either just really want --n403f86 to do --n403f95 it or you can't talk anyone into --n403fbc it.
128565:65	i mean, it's that, it's that kind of like half inch of foam or something.
128588:57	if i do like sit ups, i'll throw a, a towel down or something. you know,
128628:32	and then you go --n400834 to read some order book or something
128650:80	i think people need --n4013de to understand more like what a meter is --n401405, instead of how many feet --n401424 in a meter or something. just get used to --n401453 using all the terms.
128707:3	or, you have highway signs saying speed limit, uh, eighty, eighty-five, whatever --n403259 would be the appropriate number.
128736:29	but we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system.
128747:19	uh, advice on son or daughter going to college.
128763:50	i guess when you're, when you're eighteen or so --n40073c, uh, it --n400753 would be important to know if it was a coed college.
128768:129	and, uh, i guess they'd have --n400bbc to consider how expensive the college is --n400bdf and how close to home, if they could handle --n400c0e being away for real long periods of time or if they need --n400c45 to be somewhere where they can drive home when they needed --n400c78 to get home --n400c8b --n400c92.
128789:71	and also, uh, depending on how, uh, uh, adjustable --n401427 your child would be --n40143e, or, or flexible, i guess it would be, uh,
128793:82	and, uh, you have --n4019ae to be more flexible and more willing --n4019d1 to, uh, uh, adjust to other people's mannerisms and customs or ways of doing things.
128813:122	if they're used to the northern weather then the southern weather they might kind of feel like they need --n40229a to go out and play all the time, not be in --n4022d1 studying. if you're in florida or california.
128817:104	i, i'd also advise them that, uh, if mom and dad paid for their college, that, uh, if they decided --n4024f7 to drop a course or decided that they need another year, then they'd have --n40253e to get a loan --n402555 to continue.
128822:176	well, course mumblex it, it is a big factor in having an understanding of how much parents will pay --n4027c6 and how much --n4027d9 has --n4027e4 to come from other sources and your willingness, one, to, to work during the summer or, or part time. and two, uh, to, to take out loans to assume, uh, debt after college.
128833:3	or it's a lot cheaper --n402e96 if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school, uh,
129214:70	and i've seen in more --n40112a in durham than i have in raleigh or, or or chapel hill.
129218:39	chapel hill is kind of a, a ritzy city or whatever.
129231:28	houston is averaging about two --n401867 a week or three or four,
129231:32	houston is averaging about two --n401867 a week or three or four,
129238:52	seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or, or, like i say, drug related.
129289:25	or, or, or, you know, they're, they're in their forties or, or whatever.
129289:87	or, or, or, you know, they're, they're in their forties or, or whatever.
129307:41	the houses here, uh, before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so
129330:26	but, unemployment --n4043e9 now in dallas, or in texas is up around six point,
129370:15	so it seems wetter or something like that.
129434:3	or,
129463:13	but no big mountains or anything.
129553:3	or,
129596:3	or,
129730:33	i mean, i didn't talk to the guy or anything,
129768:34	i said if i knew beyond a doubt --n40263c or if i felt beyond a doubt --n40265f that he had done it, yeah, i guess i could convict him,
129802:73	well, they can't, they can, i think --n403095 in the punishment phase but not in the guilt or innocence because he hasn't been, he hasn't been found --n4030f4 guilty of it.
129837:27	and just depending on whether you say yes or no, uh, you, you can give him capital punishment
129876:44	i mean, i don't know whether i'd stay in prison or not
129877:3	or,
130040:62	well, i found out after --n4018c5 washing out many a peanut butter jar that they're not a recycling number one or two.
130120:37	but i think the city one could possibly look into that or something.
130152:64	they must be trying --n403ac9 to keep track of, you know, who --n403af4 is doing it, or what, i guess --n403b23.
130233:71	now, you know, i mean somebody, a s-, s-, serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns, you know, fifty, fifty children in a school yard,
130263:14	or, or there is a good chance you're going --n401876 to get off.
130353:76	i think it was outlawed --n40384b for a while, but, uh, by the supreme court, i mean, or, the interpretation of the constitution
130386:58	i mean, the, the movie was made --n4043d8 in, like, nineteen sixty-two or something like that
130524:36	i mean, i wasn't a great asset to them or anything.
130589:20	and i went to a vineyard or two in germany.
130690:27	you probably get charged --n40130f like a nickel or something like that.
130722:82	but, uh, they have sort of like, uh, things that you c-, you're not like reimbursed for --n401b5d or paid for --n401b70.
130737:44	but they, they said they can't be smashed or else, uh, it doesn't fit in their little containers
130738:61	and they're not reimbursed --n402091 by the, the people who --n4020b0 are over them or something.
130776:54	and, uh, so, you know, if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings, anything that they can pass --n402e92 on to the consumer, you know,
130777:64	it kind of reminds me of --n403030 using an a t m card, you know, --n40305f to get money or doing your banking.
130806:107	uh, another thing i thought of --n403980, i guess, --n40399b to recycle --n4039aa would be like clothes, because i mean everybody gets rid --n4039dd of their clothes sometime or other.
130813:41	and what you're going --n403eef to basically donate to a goodwill or whatever, anyways, you can get a little bit of money for --n403f46.
130983:3	or,
131022:62	and, you know, we had originally thought we'd have --n4033ca to get a fix up special or something because --n4033f5 being from the northeast we figured we couldn't afford anything.
131247:91	i'm sure, in dallas since you're big places, a lot more women are, uh, working right out of their home with their p c's or with their lap computers or whatever.
131247:104	i'm sure, in dallas since you're big places, a lot more women are, uh, working right out of their home with their p c's or with their lap computers or whatever.
131265:36	you only have --n13966 to check in with the office once or twice a week
131355:12	are they married or what.
131487:26	they, uh, just working up there or going to school or what.
131487:37	they, uh, just working up there or going to school or what.
131621:114	and between a person's religion, uh, their, their faith in their maker w-, whether, you know, uh, whether you're christian or jewish or whatever, uh,
131621:118	and between a person's religion, uh, their, their faith in their maker w-, whether, you know, uh, whether you're christian or jewish or whatever, uh,
131688:137	and my mother who --n400e1e is now, he's, my stepfather is dead, but my mother who --n400e65 is now seventy-one, i can remember her being, i believe --n400ea0 a sixteen --n400eaf or a fourteen --n400ec2 handicap,
131692:34	they'd leave work and go to a golf course, or a little country club --n40122f they belonged to --n401246 back in richmond, virginia and just, uh, play nine holes of golf.
131989:22	uh, his name is t q or something like that.
132029:43	and there is a little bitty mall that --n4027c8 looks kind of like, or, strip kind of center.
132082:37	haven't been doing much of that for the last year or so.
132403:109	but, you know by the time i get over the gym and, and go for my class and shower and get back to work --n4028f9, it is probably two hours or more
132428:45	and, uh, it does going --n403095 to start whether you are there or not.
132494:68	i still just don't don't end up --n403ff3 going cause it isn't at a convenient time or i don't know something,
132495:66	but i need --n40414b to do something. if, if it's only walk the dog or something.
132530:36	and i, i think one way or the other, we're going --n4005f5 to pay for the bureaucracy, i guess --n400620.
132536:65	i remember every time, it seems like, we turned around --n400d22, they're adding another nickel or a few more cents onto the price of gasoline.
132601:54	well, it, it's just like having taxes on --n403070, or exemptions for --n403087 kids, you know.
132615:33	now, i don't know if that's true or not,
132821:30	but, uh, it'll go up to fifty or sixty almost.
132868:3	or would i, would i probably actually buy.
132871:76	oh, well, if you, if you had all your, all the money in the world or something.
132893:45	but i maybe would buy a b m w. uh, or, or even a volvo.
132975:27	i'm not sure those are avis or not,
133037:86	and, uh, at the time we bought it --n402dc9 it was like, you know, i don't know, four hundred and twenty-five dollars or something extra.
133071:23	it didn't actually dent the car or anything.
133192:38	you know, you feel like you're in a boat or something, you know,
133208:25	that a little town or, or a bigger city.
133310:3	or is how you end up --n4020c4.
133365:89	uh, you can't, you can't even work an answering machine if you're at work and had --n403a83 to get a message or something, you know, or fill out an application to work at mcdonalds if you can't read.
133365:106	uh, you can't, you can't even work an answering machine if you're at work and had --n403a83 to get a message or something, you know, or fill out an application to work at mcdonalds if you can't read.
133392:61	um, short term, i don't think anything's going --n400085 to be done --n400098 about it or probably should be done --n4000bb about it.
133405:39	and that effectively adds to whether it's officially on the books or not.
133415:190	um, i'm not really, uh, sure that i even understand why the administration is proposing, for instance, tax reductions --n400b04, because it seems to me that if, if, if they're talking about reducing, uh, the tax that --n400b83 needs --n400b8e to be paid --n400ba1, or the tax that --n400bbc's currently being paid --n400bd3, then that can't, it seems to me it can't possibly, you know, help with the, the deficit picture.
133422:57	um, and the, the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do --n401117 without, uh, --n40112e bringing on, on serious problems for the longer term.
133470:27	mumblex well, can be done --n402e84 or will be done --n402e9f are two different things.
133587:17	left a fitting loose, or didn't use teflon tape on one of them or something like that.
133587:45	left a fitting loose, or didn't use teflon tape on one of them or something like that.
133756:3	or what's the,
133914:36	but i can carry as much --n400e55 --n400e5c in my honda or more than i can in, in those other bigger cars.
133976:53	because i, i, i run over to crystal city, or used --n402149 to,
134049:25	i think i've bought one or two new cars in my life,
134050:83	and i've tended --n4042f6 to, um, to, uh, buy cars that --n404329 are, you know, two or three, and sometimes even four and five or six years old.
134050:101	and i've tended --n4042f6 to, um, to, uh, buy cars that --n404329 are, you know, two or three, and sometimes even four and five or six years old.
134089:60	and they do post, uh, uh, warnings for people who --n4005af have, uh, heart diseases or respiratory problems during that summer season.
134196:40	do you find that, um, or, or do you hypothesize that, that most of the, uh, smog or, or air pollution comes from vehicles
134196:103	do you find that, um, or, or do you hypothesize that, that most of the, uh, smog or, or air pollution comes from vehicles
134197:3	or does it come mostly from industry up there.
134301:3	or, just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty.
134333:22	we don't even have any concrete or asphalt.
134503:24	it's called --n400fa0 v c x or something like that.
134602:17	like, uh, boeing or mcdonald douglas or something like that was supposed --n402e11 to buy, uh, a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it, you know, purely commercial
134602:24	like, uh, boeing or mcdonald douglas or something like that was supposed --n402e11 to buy, uh, a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it, you know, purely commercial
134602:70	like, uh, boeing or mcdonald douglas or something like that was supposed --n402e11 to buy, uh, a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it, you know, purely commercial
134664:33	so, with those little republican-, republics or whatever
134703:78	and, uh, right now we're in a, uh, i guess it's --n4001fb either a zero lot line or a garden home. which you might call it --n40023e.
134876:74	well, i took a lot of time in --n402ba9 choosing this site because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning.
134989:25	i don't know if that took or not,
135062:52	so that, at least i can do --n401543, you know, --n40155a watching t v or whatever
135080:40	so that's not really my favorite thing to do --n4018dd or anything,
135172:28	have you ever had it, uh, crack or break or leak.
135172:32	have you ever had it, uh, crack or break or leak.
135188:3	or,
135231:8	a jar or something
135232:3	or.
135311:15	survival of the fittest or something.
135320:83	well and then, you think, well, how did they do it --n405301 out in the real world anyway when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are --n40534c --n405353 kind of trying --n405366 to keep up with that --n405381,
135414:37	seems like it was the spy went --n401545 dancing, or something like that.
135677:7	saturday or sunday they were saying --n401026,
135986:74	i just like --n400b01 to have the t v on if, you know, if i'm home alone or something
135991:11	either the radio or the t v --s got --n400cb9 to be on, the whole time.
136020:63	i usually do if i'm home for a couple of days, like, you know, around christmas or whatever,
136036:18	it was like general hospital or something
136063:50	i don't even know if there's any other shows that i watch --n401e84 or else.
136249:3	or,
136285:25	been pulling them up, huh, or just loosening them until the rain came in.
136298:23	and there are parts of downtown or near downtown dallas that --n4007a4 are under water right now, i guess --n4007cf,
136324:14	or, or mumblex.
136335:21	did you put them up originally or just going up and stopping leaks in them.
136362:3	or is it pretty steep.
136383:3	or you been doing some remodeling work on it.
136406:56	well, it, uh, depending on its moisture content, it either swells up or shrinks,
136418:78	and, uh, but anytime there's a change in the weather, like the temperature, drastic changes in temperature or in, uh, moisture --n402e93, uh, you get little spider web cracks all around, uh, windows and doors.
136442:15	but, uh, somehow or other that does manage --n403507 to, uh, show these little cracks.
136617:59	well, if you're kind of a person that --n40229c likes things, you know, organized or neat
136621:3	or, you know
136752:35	they need --n404aeb to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what --n404b22's,
136821:73	you wonder if they're, it --n40101c's really worth it to pay, uh, thirty-five dollars or forty dollars --n40105f just to get in.
136832:3	or,
136987:23	it's been because of the size or some problem like that.
136997:23	and they're broken in one way or another.
136998:35	but i don't know if that's just kids, or if that's, uh,
137109:71	if you purchase on your credit card you know, then they put an extended warranty on it if it doesn't work or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time,
137136:3	or it means it's old enough that it's time to replace the whole thing --n4036aa.
137234:56	this summer we went to, uh, the smokey mountain national park. and, uh, stayed about three or four days in there.
137574:82	course, i think, you know, you can't really go by what --n40272e happened earlier in the season because teams jell together or they've had injuries that --n402771 heal
137591:36	they've won, like, i think --n402c12 six or seven in a row now,
137712:3	or somebody that --n4007b8's maybe got a cadillac or lincoln and lexus dealership, uh
137712:34	or somebody that --n4007b8's maybe got a cadillac or lincoln and lexus dealership, uh
137750:18	there is only about five or six options.
137781:83	it can raise the car's center up a little bit. for going under a lot of piled up stuff if you were up in michigan or somewhere.
137818:79	we had this group of, uh, surveyors come into, uh, a shop i was working in --n4021ba, uh, four or five of them,
137821:43	but, while they were there they set back, drank about four or five cups of coffee apiece and made snowmen on the hoods of their vehicles threw snowballs all over the place, had themselves a ball for about an hour.
137870:64	so the only thing i had --n40344f to decide on --n403462 was whether i wanted a c d --n403485 or not in the stereo system
137872:18	and they had like three or four basic packages that they they offer --n403623.
137885:11	imagine, or not,
138057:3	or this, uh generation's just kind of changed a little bit, uh,
138119:3	or,
138210:3	or yes,
138235:84	and i, i debate whether it --n4027f8's better to get a, uh, just a straight table saw or to get one of these, uh, rotary arm saws.
138255:100	well and with a radial arm saw, if you do have a, a big piece of wood that you need --n402f12 to rip, like you say, or cut --n402f3d, you wouldn't be able --n402f5c to do that.
138283:70	and it --n403892's kind of, uh, hard to get, uh, shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that.
138291:77	i'd, i'd kind of like --n403d01 to, to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say, a table saw and some of those things that --n403d70 would make, uh, some pretty nice, uh, pieces of, uh, well, wood, for, for different things for tables, for, for, uh, chairs, for, you know, decks and so forth
138377:95	and, uh, i was kind of m-, mad that they had never noticed that and, either pointed it out to me or, or, uh tried --n4014f4 to say, look, you're holding your,
138388:14	she was four, or three,
138393:65	like i said, i didn't notice it till then. because i hadn't worked with writing letters or anything and stuff like that.
138508:3	or is everything okay.
138712:57	uh, i don't remember what they call it --n400ad6, sort of like a positive, negatives or some, some kind of word they use --n400b31 when a, uh, you get a, uh, a positive indication of drugs --n400b90, but there's not really, there weren't really any there --n400bcb.
138784:73	make sure it's a lot safer because a couple of people are going --n402318 to be discriminated against --n40232f unfairly or whatever.
138792:35	and then, i don't know if he still does or what because i don't know if sam's is actually part of it,
138826:8	two or three years in with them you can start --n402d41 buying stock
138859:3	or,
138943:21	you may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting --n400b2c in december,
138943:25	you may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting --n400b2c in december,
138943:32	you may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting --n400b2c in december,
139014:49	people that i know --n401af8 that --n401b03 come from, uh, like georgia or north carolina, yeah, they say, it's,
139019:32	it's not as humid. as houston, say, or atlanta,
139076:3	or was that just vacation or something.
139076:17	or was that just vacation or something.
139090:3	or you know, first an alphabet is developed --n402cf1
139172:43	and then when you get one of those tornado type systems --n40419e through or severe hail or thunderstorms --n4041bd
139172:50	and then when you get one of those tornado type systems --n40419e through or severe hail or thunderstorms --n4041bd
139221:5	right or wrong.
139224:5	right or wrong,
139225:66	i don't think is, is, we can determine whether we were right or wrong,
139243:38	wonder what --n4022d5 happens to this little beastie on call waiting or something.
139264:47	i had thought that they had, uh, colonies there, or something.
139294:19	i was just probably three or four years,
139390:26	and have, you know, like three or four couples come over,
139418:63	i'm in favor of very little clean up, um, very little planning because we've got three or four couples that we get together with --n401e91 --n401e98 to play games,
139466:13	you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it
139481:20	and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven,
139490:160	now i've done it with, where you put, you cook the ri-, well, i guess you probably could do it same way, but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup, and put a little bit of white wine in it --n402ede.
139531:3	or, you know semi mumblex.
139547:3	or,
139563:22	and for when i cook pasta or something --n40412b, i'll put a little bit of bouillon in there --n40415e just to give it a little extra flavor.
139605:3	or do you go ahead and let it cook through.
139625:23	put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want --n405049 to do that, you know. what ever, however much effort you feel like --n405090 putting --n40509b into it.
139666:16	a matter of choice, or compulsion.
139669:72	it seems like, we've always been at a place where we'd have --n4004e1 to go away for the summer or something --n400508
139715:64	it was al-, almost always at least one cat, sometimes, you know, like fifteen or twenty.
139777:33	that's pretty much the south end of the state, or the southern quarter of the state, anyway..
139813:7	hills, or what.
139884:38	are you, uh, shooting for a bachelor's --n403328 now, or a master's, or what.
139884:49	are you, uh, shooting for a bachelor's --n403328 now, or a master's, or what.
139927:102	well, i, i was wondering what, if you all were --n403e41 to get a pet, like if you were --n403e6c to move into an apartment or a house somewhere,
139930:62	uh, well, um, first off we'd probably wind up with a, a cat or maybe a puppy.
139942:19	uh, had a hamster or two,
140027:33	i guess we didn't have it high enough or he didn't get hit --n401253 in just the right spot,
140033:105	well, speaking of pets, i'll tell you, my, my kids are older now, my, both of them are either in or out of college,
140143:61	and, and, uh, we went down to canton one time oh, gosh, two or three years ago now,
140209:3	or are you so busy you don't have time --n10a75 to do it --n10a88.
140511:3	or is it.
140714:73	and, you know, you don't want --n401625 to, you don't want --n401644 to spank it or scare it, or anything like that,
140714:83	and, you know, you don't want --n401625 to, you don't want --n401644 to spank it or scare it, or anything like that,
140767:28	uh, she can't hear worth a darn or see very well,
140804:62	and so it, i mean this dog really feels like it's being killed --n403153 or something when you try --n40316e to, you know, tug on it --n403195 to walk it --n4031a8.
140815:62	you know, maybe you nee-, you can get it signed --n403671 up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes.
140819:33	they sometimes mis-, misuse their license or whatever you know,
140928:22	he gets home from work late or whatever
140937:3	or is it pretty natural.
141002:47	and that's kind of like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son,
141145:35	that is why we only do it once every five or ten years --n4007d5.
141203:3	or, uh, sometimes it has been like on a saturday afternoon.
141293:3	or do you all like mail out stuff.
141320:25	i married your cousin's brother's uncle or something like that.
141628:3	or, you know.
141662:106	and then i, i figure if there's big, big news, i'll hear it from my husband --n400a06 when he gets home --n400a1d or, someone else, you know.
141687:3	or,
141741:42	i've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something,
141741:46	i've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something,
141851:3	or i don't know.
141909:3	or some things are, um, you know,
141931:26	so, we will play either out there or at firewheel.
141936:3	or do you pull a cart when you play golf --n4006e0.
142114:34	and i don't do anything to mine, water them or anything.
142117:49	and i even had, uh, i guess it was --n403d5f last year or the year before, i had some out
142177:29	but uh, even my first, uh, eight or nine years of working, i camped almost all of the time because i was in construction.
142326:116	first, we went up just to, uh, with a toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our, uh, hot dogs by the fire or whatever.
142436:19	now, i asked janice, or somebody recently how you do that --n40081b uh, when you paint the ceilings --n40083e you know where you have got that textured stuff, that they have special rollers that --n400885 are real soft and furry that you paint --n4008ac that with --n4008bb --n4008c2.
142485:97	i think i am going --n4015bc to put something like a brown on it, on the outside. and maybe, a little deeper brown --n401613 in the entry way or something so it will stand out a little.
142494:21	or, two tone, or two tone. you know.
142626:11	like thirteen bucks or something.
142648:51	and when he got outside --n403ecd, he noticed his receipt was like thirteen ninety-nine or something.
142727:53	but a little bit from three, you know, from thirty million dollars or thirty-five mil-, that's a lot of money.
143012:3	or this summer i went to colorado
143069:65	and over there, you know, every time we'd go and, and eat dinner or lunch or whatever --n402f2b we'd always have --n402f42 to ask for the check you know
143069:69	and over there, you know, every time we'd go and, and eat dinner or lunch or whatever --n402f2b we'd always have --n402f42 to ask for the check you know
143084:47	like, would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place, or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week.
143232:3	or,
143238:29	and so, uh, we really want four or five bedroom house
143249:92	and you can cut, you know, the listings, uh, in about a third when you go from three to four bedrooms --n4011e3 --n4011ea you know, or five.
143253:3	or you settled --n40137f,
143287:56	so, we're looking forward to --n4018a5 retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to florida or somewhere. closer, closer to our families.
143356:54	seems like you get in that category, you're in the three hundred thousand dollar homes or whatever
143383:70	lot of people will buy, in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or the, or do something.
143383:89	lot of people will buy, in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or the, or do something.
143409:35	then i would let her narrow it down to three or four,
143478:98	when we moved from louisiana to denver --n4048c3, it --n4048d2 was astounding, you know, to find that prices were, oh, i guess almost two or three times as high as we'd expected.
143584:3	or,
143588:93	and, uh, people there were saying that the way that the schools were going --n402f4b, a lot of people were going away and going to private schools, or else going to home, where they taught their kids at home --n402fbe. or, you know, anything but the public schools and the ones that --n403001 did have, you know, the kids,
143726:73	it --n401925's really easy, just to forget, you know, that you, you charged that or charged that.
143761:29	i don't know if it was tennessee or arkansas or some, some other state --n4023c8 had a visa card that --n4023e3 was the lowest one in the country.
143761:34	i don't know if it was tennessee or arkansas or some, some other state --n4023c8 had a visa card that --n4023e3 was the lowest one in the country.
143772:26	and i think it's eighteen percent or something
143809:43	for the amount that i charge --n402fa3, i get two dollars back or something
143849:35	but i still don't know if sears will take visa or mastercard.
143964:138	i think if it's, uh, if it's a con-, if it's a convicted, uh, felon on parole uh, and he goes out and, and commits another crime or kills somebody, i, you know, i, i feel the same way,
144074:19	and, uh, or he'll have somebody lie for him.
144163:103	you know, he doesn't have, they don't have --n400ff3 to rely on him --n40100a to score ev-, you know, thirty or forty points at every at every game
144190:3	or is it tim hardaway.
144197:16	and they traded either richmond or hardaway to sacramento for billy owens
144355:73	uh, when they asked us did, did we want --n40041b to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less --n400466, i think uh, i think right now what they're spending --n4004b1 is adequate. uh, my, for my personal opinion. uh, because i think it's something that --n400510's going --n40051f to take them a while --n40053e to come up with a, uh, vaccine for --n40056d.
144369:3	or i think they already would have by now, you know.
144467:81	and, uh, course, i'm not all ready --n4022d7 to just run out there and start --n4022fa dating everybody i can --n402319 or anything.
144687:3	or is that a crime free zone there.
144793:82	uh, it --n401e10 was really frightening to, think that, uh, it --n401e47's not even safe to drive onto the tollway, or for those people in the tollbooth.
144961:19	and even in the last five or six years, boy we see more and more women being involved
144983:34	every once in a while you read in the newspaper --n401815 or you'll see it on t v or something --n401844 where the discussion comes out that, you know, women are paid --n40187f less than men --n401892
144983:58	every once in a while you read in the newspaper --n401815 or you'll see it on t v or something --n401844 where the discussion comes out that, you know, women are paid --n40187f less than men --n401892
145001:59	but there's still a, an, an inequality in the work forces or jobs.
145019:79	a woman congressman i'm sure --n402493 makes as much as a man congressman as, and the same as a senator or whatever.
145063:39	and hers was the only income we had --n403994 for three or four months
145167:70	uh, are you going --n400847 to, uh, put your son in child care in a, a year or two.
145555:164	if you've got a pretty good rating, uh, credit rating you can call your in-, you know, your, your card, wherever you got your card from --n4043ef and tell them, hey, either drop my rates or drop my, you know, uh annual fees
145556:3	or i'll just go to somewhere else.
145577:99	um, i might try that because i, i have one card that i've had --n4049b4 for about, uh, i don't know, nine or ten years.
145587:30	and yours is at, you know, eighteen or nineteen percent.
145617:87	but, uh, uh, hi-, in his family, uh, what they usually do --n40035f, on his dad's side, his mom or, uh, the aunts will send out little postcards, like, two or three weeks before reminding everyone where the, the, where to meet --n400412 and, you know, --n40042d just, to bring anything,
145617:127	but, uh, uh, hi-, in his family, uh, what they usually do --n40035f, on his dad's side, his mom or, uh, the aunts will send out little postcards, like, two or three weeks before reminding everyone where the, the, where to meet --n400412 and, you know, --n40042d just, to bring anything,
145619:33	and then they just meet at, like, a park or something --n400786 to have like a, a short, uh, or a small, uh, dinner type thing.
145647:33	and then they just sort of do like a little program or, you know, something like that so that everyone's sort of involved --n401624.
145657:25	so we just have --n4019e4 to either or, give a formal invite
145702:45	and, and they always have, you know, two or three new ones --n402a8f to add --n402a9e to the list, you know,
145704:3	or someone passed away
145705:3	or, you know, something like that
145709:32	and so everyone has --n402ce8 to update their little books or whatever.
145722:85	i didn't, you know, i, i didn't even know their names, some of the two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles
145779:3	or where are you at --n400392.
145811:26	i can tell you about my last job or whatever you want --n400866 to talk about --n400879 that or my husband's or what i think --n4008a4.
145811:59	i can tell you about my last job or whatever you want --n400866 to talk about --n400879 that or my husband's or what i think --n4008a4.
145811:68	i can tell you about my last job or whatever you want --n400866 to talk about --n400879 that or my husband's or what i think --n4008a4.
145844:39	go to work when i wanted --n4010b5 to --n4010c4 or not
146127:11	have you crocheted or knitted any baby clothes or baby blankets.
146127:24	have you crocheted or knitted any baby clothes or baby blankets.
146138:3	or how did you make a quilt --n401b3b.
146148:18	i didn't piece it or anything like that
146157:3	or were you a-,
146198:149	well, one thing that i like --n402c70 about this fabric painting thing is i can just make a t shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then, um, cut out a little pattern --n402cf3 from the material, from some material, like flowers or something, and make, um, a design or, you know, a little arrangement or something on the shirt and, you know, fuse it on with heat and bond, or whatever and then paint around it.
146198:173	well, one thing that i like --n402c70 about this fabric painting thing is i can just make a t shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then, um, cut out a little pattern --n402cf3 from the material, from some material, like flowers or something, and make, um, a design or, you know, a little arrangement or something on the shirt and, you know, fuse it on with heat and bond, or whatever and then paint around it.
146198:194	well, one thing that i like --n402c70 about this fabric painting thing is i can just make a t shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then, um, cut out a little pattern --n402cf3 from the material, from some material, like flowers or something, and make, um, a design or, you know, a little arrangement or something on the shirt and, you know, fuse it on with heat and bond, or whatever and then paint around it.
146198:243	well, one thing that i like --n402c70 about this fabric painting thing is i can just make a t shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then, um, cut out a little pattern --n402cf3 from the material, from some material, like flowers or something, and make, um, a design or, you know, a little arrangement or something on the shirt and, you know, fuse it on with heat and bond, or whatever and then paint around it.
146215:108	but when i washed them --n4035d7, although i took the precaution of --n4035fa turning them inside out i really didn't do anything else. and truly, everything --n403641 fell off, or most of it.
146298:71	uh, i haven't seen any of the movies because i just barely, just like in the last year or so got interested in it,
146324:10	the older one or the youn-, the newer one.
146342:69	because he, he thinks the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something,
146381:3	or is this, is there a series on.
146408:68	see i don't know if that's a, the movie of the week or, or what,
146409:30	but it seems like there's only about four or five different ones,
146422:11	on the set or something.
146452:33	i've heard of, a lot of people somehow or something.
146453:33	they'll say, so and so from twin peaks, or something, you know.
146522:172	i, i believe, if i, am in a position, uh, like when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care --n4007ec --n4007f3 that i will be able --n40080e to just bring her --n400825 into my home and my father also, and uh, or have someone go into their home, you know and uh, and look after them.
146529:68	i would find it --n400bfd very difficult, uh, to, uh, place eit-, my father or my step-mother uh, in a place like that. particularly, since i know how they feel about it --n400c94.
146661:26	and i can take plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them
146694:19	besides, well like a law or whatever.
146734:84	every time you buy a container --n40224d, no matter what it is --n40226c, whether it is glass, whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever, you pay ten cents for it
146734:98	every time you buy a container --n40224d, no matter what it is --n40226c, whether it is glass, whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever, you pay ten cents for it
146734:105	every time you buy a container --n40224d, no matter what it is --n40226c, whether it is glass, whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever, you pay ten cents for it
146818:44	well, i image everybody else will start --n403af6 doing that sooner or later,
146851:73	do they not ever, i mean, i don't know that much. do they not ever burn trash or anything like,
147025:20	we're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to --n12bca running around like that.
147056:46	it doesn't matter if i have --n1339c to wash it a hundred times or something.
147058:55	when you were teaching --n13476, did you ever have, uh, uh, a blue jean day or anything like that.
147067:46	i know that some of the schools they have, uh, country western day or something like that one, you know, or tacky day,
147067:72	i know that some of the schools they have, uh, country western day or something like that one, you know, or tacky day,
147128:8	the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes.
147141:84	and, and there's this big debate --n4014b4 apparently about whether the ozone, there's a hole in the ozone or not
147189:45	we can drive into, when we've been on vacation or something --n402921 drive into fort worth or dallas
147189:68	we can drive into, when we've been on vacation or something --n402921 drive into fort worth or dallas
147238:79	and, and i'm, i'm not sure how long it's going --n4040fc to take --n40410b or what it's going --n404126 to take --n404135 because they keep --n404148 saying that the economy is going --n404167 to depend on how many cars and, houses we sell --n40419a.
147460:3	or,
147534:31	they, they stay at work or go back to work. or whatever.
147719:68	is it p-, do you think it --n400176's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government.
147753:3	or are they in there for their own gains,
147828:136	and it almost seems like in order --n402b7e to avoid, uh, some of the scandal, you would have --n402bb9 to have the kind of wife that you would only find --n402bec, on, say in the bobsy twins or, something like that.
147886:19	usually involving the prime minister or people very close to him.
147895:3	or i can,
147918:3	or what era do you, era do you like --n400324 the most.
147927:43	um, do you go to the operas that they sing english --n4006ab or go to the ones that they sing other languages --n4006da.
147989:35	so, i get --n401dcf to go to at least four or five concerts a year.
147997:26	so they're doing this in school, or what.
148014:67	well, since you seem --n40224f to like, uh, italian music, have you ever, uh, gotten into gabrielli or anybody there in that era, the, uh, period right before, actually before vivaldi, i guess.
148034:27	can't you get records --n4029c1 through that or something, recordings.
148037:55	uh, they know have them on compact disc or or, uh, or cassettes or l p --s,
148037:63	uh, they know have them on compact disc or or, uh, or cassettes or l p --s,
148047:58	but they also, uh, they also, uh, go to the different composers, or the different, i guess,
148136:3	or,
148140:30	more likely to see those at a ski show or something,
148231:29	but then eventually there'll be a school project or something where my son will need --n12506 to refer back through forty-eight back issues --n12529 to find you know, france or something or whatever --n12558 it is --n12567 he's looking for --n12582 --n12589.
148231:97	but then eventually there'll be a school project or something where my son will need --n12506 to refer back through forty-eight back issues --n12529 to find you know, france or something or whatever --n12558 it is --n12567 he's looking for --n12582 --n12589.
148231:102	but then eventually there'll be a school project or something where my son will need --n12506 to refer back through forty-eight back issues --n12529 to find you know, france or something or whatever --n12558 it is --n12567 he's looking for --n12582 --n12589.
148351:10	the acid rock or the heavy metal.
148422:49	most, most likely i would be listen to, uh, jazz or classical music.
148439:15	what about the blues or something like that.
148489:3	or, uh, what, what merle haggard and faron young
148562:39	and they have their faced all contorted, like it hurts them or something.
148585:32	i think it was like five of them or something
148590:3	or.
148597:8	last year or the year before,
148616:32	uh, i haven't done any of the oil or watercolor.
148624:46	i, i took one class about, i guess three or four years ago
148679:3	or do you brush it on.
148768:29	well, have you sold any of your furniture or just,
148905:3	or,
148923:62	i had a passport and was ready --n4010b2 to go or um, out of the country or join special forces,
148979:16	and was it a dolphin or a torpedo.
148982:82	i vaguely remember we, um, we had a, we had a, um, spy ship torpedoed --n40234f or something.
148987:58	and finally president johnson said, well, they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo.
149098:49	well, do you use your computer for, um, just things around the house, or in the mumblex.
149109:3	or are they based, are they based
149180:3	or, you know, if they were really great they had sixty-four k.
149293:47	and he's the only one that allows --n401075 him to touch him or pet him or love him
149293:55	and he's the only one that allows --n401075 him to touch him or pet him or love him
149317:31	you wouldn't want him to carry her off or something.
149345:54	well, do you live, you, you in a house, or a place where you, uh,
149373:37	you know, i saw something --n402677 on c n n or on cable here a while ago that --n4026ae showed some people that --n4026c5 had rabbits in apartments and in houses,
149387:37	and do they, they just paper train it or something.
149423:33	it's on, i think --n4033e6, two or three nights for maybe an hour or two
149423:51	it's on, i think --n4033e6, two or three nights for maybe an hour or two
149461:27	well do you all work for t i, or for,
149513:20	hell you can buy a coke or something for that.
149535:62	i mean, you know, in retrospect, um, was it, was it mondale or dukakis that --n401302 said, you know, i'll, i'll tell you right now i'm going --n401351 to raise taxes.
149552:16	read my lips, or whatever
149578:81	but with this peace dividend, it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works projects like they had in the thirties, or whatever.
149689:3	or you know, it doesn't seem that it's going --n40516b to make much of a difference.
149797:3	or.
149809:3	or don't get
149875:3	or,
149918:3	or was that all there was --n404494, body.
150028:44	so i don't know if i could have taken it to another retailer or not.
150048:18	i've had two or three of those go out.
150077:3	or do you just test,
150084:23	i think they test four or five a day, --n402c86 actually exploding the air bags
150089:28	after we assemble each part of the inflator or what --n402ea1 explodes the bag, we check --n402ec0 to make sure it's there after we install it,
150122:69	uh, i would say the medical, uh, group insurance area as far as, uh, covering medical costs for yourself or family members.
150146:3	or now we're on a managed care thing, which --n400ae9 has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any.
150171:18	they usually sign a contract or something
150183:54	uh, if you've been going to a doctor for, you know, ten years or something and he elects --n40177e not to join, it can be very stressful for you know, those people.
150256:47	and i don't know who --n403131 looks forward to it more, the students or the teachers and the staff.
150276:117	i would think that that type of employment, you're, you're, one day you might be really tuned in and the next day, oh, a little luke warm or something
150314:19	um, so those are more or less indoor sports.
150321:38	um, i like --n4005c7 to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring, fall,
150350:31	do you do, uh, any anaerobic type, weight lifting or weight training type exercise.
150385:24	are you familiar with, um, step or bench aerobics.
150405:11	but now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over.
150449:64	and, um, --n402897 we-, wearing that i haven't had any problems in the past year or so.
150475:29	i mean, it would only take three or four days
150576:3	or do you watch like the macneil lehrer hour.
150641:65	and that's, that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of --n40289e, or like the updates, like of --n4028c5 what --n4028d0's going on in science without --n4028ef getting into a lot of detail that --n402912 would, you know, bog me down that i wouldn't know about --n402951
150653:3	or if i, you know, am interested in something,
150663:30	if they put it out in a video, or on, not a video but a cassette tape or something, where you could just listen to it --n40342e i would do that while i was doing other things.
150663:56	if they put it out in a video, or on, not a video but a cassette tape or something, where you could just listen to it --n40342e i would do that while i was doing other things.
150670:77	well, i remember back during the, uh, during the war, everyone here at work always had the radio or the t v on, because that, they were going constantly with that stuff.
150697:21	it's like sixteen hundred days or something.
150716:105	also big in the news right now is --n40497f the braves, because they're, uh, they're in, you know, tr-, spring training or whatever
150760:13	so were they criminal or civil.
150856:3	or,
150949:11	was it civil or criminal.
150953:10	a grand jury or,
150973:3	or did you folks do that.
150988:24	but it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like, you know,
151022:3	or would,
151063:15	was it a six or twelve member jury.
151082:68	getting to this unanimous thing, whether, you know, a jury should be unanimous or not, or not, in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous.
151151:32	oh, i thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine.
151209:3	or do they.
151239:56	but i'm not sure if if it's if you get caught --n402b78 or if you turn yourself in.
151277:32	and i'm not sure if our policy covers that or not.
151289:3	or is it.
151327:145	well, i think, i think we, i think the problem here is, is that a, a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs.
151339:28	i wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when i'm flying in an airplane --n401369.
151345:3	or, you know, it,
151350:3	or,
151366:42	and, i mean, i'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs,
151394:47	and i don't really want you to look at it, or or something pretty basic like that,
151429:3	or,
151431:80	uh, i really think it should be, except as i've mentioned twice now, in the specified industries or, or jobs, because there are certain things where it --n4043cb's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times --n404402.
151529:83	i guess probably the most helpful thing was that, um, for the rent, we rented like a, a rescue squad building or something like that.
151544:42	and each person in the family, you know, brought a dish, or something.
151548:3	or did everyone just bring,
151606:34	and i don't know if your family's spread out or whatever
151631:102	uh, my immediate family, you know, my, my parents and my brothers and sisters, i guess we're the ones that --n4030ce have the gypsy blood or whatever,
151716:91	so, so i see us in a kind, somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless we, unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and, and come up with a way to, uh, have us as a part of the unemployed society be able --n40168e to be gainfully employed --n4016a5 again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting, uh, compound --n4016ec.
151716:99	so, so i see us in a kind, somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless we, unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and, and come up with a way to, uh, have us as a part of the unemployed society be able --n40168e to be gainfully employed --n4016a5 again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting, uh, compound --n4016ec.
151746:46	i hate --n40294f to see a car --n402966 --n40296d going down the street, or even a truck or bus for that matter, that --n4029b4's putting out a lot of dark smoke,
151746:57	i hate --n40294f to see a car --n402966 --n40296d going down the street, or even a truck or bus for that matter, that --n4029b4's putting out a lot of dark smoke,
151762:61	it's burned --n4031bb so completely, that you don't have any, uh, nitrous oxides, uh, or oxides of nitrogen, uh, to, uh, form --n40323e because of, by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine, because diesel oil is, uh, is not very volatile. you know, where gasoline, if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone --n40330d.
151776:116	that's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios --n4038c4 as the, as the air is heated, you know, by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio
151803:31	and during the summer we camp, uh, two or three weeks a year.
151896:22	so we go --n40219f backpacking fifteen or twenty miles,
151903:22	and they'll keep you dry or whatever.
151918:64	um, so, have you had any adventures on your camping trips, with, encounters with wild animals or anything like that.
151972:25	but they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything.
151972:33	but they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything.
152062:17	you maybe get two or three a year.
152067:40	unless you, unless you have some vacation time or some, some sick leave or whatever, um, you kind of have --n40164e to finagle your way around --n401669 to get that time.
152067:64	unless you, unless you have some vacation time or some, some sick leave or whatever, um, you kind of have --n40164e to finagle your way around --n401669 to get that time.
152148:57	i mean, the examinations and, and, uh, checkups every year, or every six months are free
152160:3	or,
152368:30	you probably have a better team, uh, cooperation, or team playing, atmosphere.
152387:44	i think you would be more willing --n403984 to either help that person or help it get accomplished --n4039b3, you know.
152408:21	are you talking about with criminal or civil suits.
152457:56	but the other two i feel --n401630, uh, would give either you know, the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law.
152475:203	i, uh, i think there is more of an ability of you know, you know for selecting a jury, two different juries that --n401cd3 would most of the time come up with the same idea, uh, the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent
152534:46	it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument --n403209.
152622:62	uh, my, my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to washington or to the state and they say they are going --n40136b to send some back,
152640:26	and when you send it to washington or send it to your state capitol --n401a99, uh, a lot of it stays there
152676:84	uh, there is an interesting proposal that --n4026bc's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax. uh, ten percent or thirteen percent.
152686:39	and you would just pay a flat tax. no exemptions, no deductions or anything else after you know, after you figure up who --n402c32's in your family.
152710:52	i mean it --n4033b5 doesn't seem right that somebody that --n4033d8 makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that --n403423 makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes.
152710:68	i mean it --n4033b5 doesn't seem right that somebody that --n4033d8 makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that --n403423 makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes.
152766:29	what what channel --n400276 do you watch --n400289 or what station.
152797:3	or,
152800:99	and you know it's, it's more like the news shows is now is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news, because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports, you know, is your kid's bus driver smoking crack, on the way to school, you know.
152813:245	also, also i have the observation --n40156a of, uh, with the press is that, like any any stories that i had any first hand knowledge of --n4015ed that i see --n401600 in the press, you know, which --n401627 only happened like ten times in my life you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that --n40169e actually had, had more than just a blurb about it. that the press has managed --n4016f5 to just mess up some aspect of the story
152847:3	or who --n4021cb killed who.
152858:52	was that like he started --n4025af shooting people, people in this cafeteria or something.
152930:68	uh, you know, not saying that we shou-, that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there,
152986:22	just, uh, stays away or runs usually.
152993:32	but if anybody reaches over --n4008e3 to pet him or whatever, he'll just kind of look at them like what are doing --n400932.
152995:15	did he raise him or something.
153003:37	and you know they are usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody.
153059:31	uh, i never felt like it was mine or anything,
153073:35	well not mutts, but mixes you know like one or two mix
153093:48	they seem --n40264e to be, i mean, listen better or something.
153155:30	uh, cause he has had him for six or seven years.
153205:52	uh, in most states as long as you aren't a convicted felon. you know or on probation or, uh, you know, other obvious things like that.
153205:60	uh, in most states as long as you aren't a convicted felon. you know or on probation or, uh, you know, other obvious things like that.
153361:37	so. well, uh, did you hear about that killeen massacre or whatever.
153364:34	the, did it happen at a cafeteria or something.
153376:44	so frank, what, uh, type of, uh, budget do you or your family have --n400078.
153451:44	i guess i kind of do a similar thing. more, uh, medium or longer range.
153459:106	and i am making every effort --n402734 to, to sal-, put a little bit away and increase the amount that i need --n40278b for a down payment or whatever.
153470:46	so, we are on a schedule where i try every, uh, three or four years --n402ca3 to, to buy a new one --n402cc6.
153520:41	uh, i have, uh, been know --n403d8b to keep trucks or cars for oh, ten or twelve years,
153520:57	uh, i have, uh, been know --n403d8b to keep trucks or cars for oh, ten or twelve years,
153670:45	you guys, uh, do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything
153671:3	or,
153702:24	i guess i am about eight or nine.
153770:93	you know, it's like what --n40390a can you do --n40391d with that, that you can't do --n403944 in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve.
153806:37	and you, uh, have you eaten yet or whatever.
153824:74	around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about, uh, i don't know, ten or twenty degrees
153841:35	and sometimes i'll read like the, uh, wall street or the new york times.
153868:23	so, it's, no fee, or subscription either to read at my leisure
153870:29	for example so i can read a certain business or topics.
153879:3	or is it something that --n400c87 is, uh, a little bit different from that.
153894:48	do you get any, uh, do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader, like more long term analytical sort of approach.
153900:66	it's a weekly but, uh, but not, uh, not like business week or news week or one of those kinds of things.
153900:73	it's a weekly but, uh, but not, uh, not like business week or news week or one of those kinds of things.
153907:62	in like, in sort of like, uh, qual-, uh, quality or sort of an orientation in terms of like, view point or the way the news is presented --n401bf0 --n401bf7 or whatever.
153907:96	in like, in sort of like, uh, qual-, uh, quality or sort of an orientation in terms of like, view point or the way the news is presented --n401bf0 --n401bf7 or whatever.
153907:125	in like, in sort of like, uh, qual-, uh, quality or sort of an orientation in terms of like, view point or the way the news is presented --n401bf0 --n401bf7 or whatever.
153940:52	well, even if it's not technical. if it's, uh, some social thing or whatever. it doesn't matter.
153947:3	or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things.
153950:82	uh, by deliberate i, uh, i mean mistake, mistakes of omission or, uh, or, uh, biased toward a particular view point a particular liberal view point that they have --n402e35.
153987:133	i would be curious --n403d0f to know what you thought --n403d2a as to how like say c n n t v news compared to the three networks --n403d71. uh, you know whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever
154033:32	uh, about every, every three months or so, we re-evaluate our budget
154077:3	or,
154138:126	it's just to, uh, uh, get up the money in advance and put it in, uh, uh, so long as it wasn't you know, unreasonably high, but for things like food expenses or whatever. just put it in uh, in an envelope or whatever
154138:168	it's just to, uh, uh, get up the money in advance and put it in, uh, uh, so long as it wasn't you know, unreasonably high, but for things like food expenses or whatever. just put it in uh, in an envelope or whatever
154157:24	uh, have you developed a savings plan or i r a s or anything like that yet.
154157:35	uh, have you developed a savings plan or i r a s or anything like that yet.
154185:3	or,
154210:3	or they have on saturday night, friday night and saturday night
154263:3	or,
154565:66	so one of the real keys, it sounds like --n401a55, to getting recycling for, uh, paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it.
154611:24	and it's more than even paper or something like that.
154612:28	there is more energy in it per pound or whatever.
154623:30	he didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that.
154677:3	or is it the same thing.
154686:3	or,
154689:23	i only do it probably two or three times a week.
154696:3	or, uh, do you belong to a group.
154703:3	or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings.
154703:16	or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings.
154706:3	or do you go alone.
154715:3	or they might play tennis
154731:8	young mothers or,
154758:3	or just,
154823:36	too bad it's not really heavy as far as recreation or hobby,
154873:15	there's snow bird or alta.
154907:14	mumblex is one or two timer a year if i do go on them
154977:28	or or are you, or are they some home distributing the funds back to you.
155014:3	or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins
155051:35	well, how to you handle that, the long range or medium range planning on finances --n400f76.
155112:55	i was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with, uh, the western accents or something like that.
155119:3	or was there another.
155153:30	uh, well i think, either my wife or i would like --n403632 to pursue advanced degrees at some point
155187:94	and then i don't, usually don't exceed that unless i, unless the visa bill gets out of hand for one reason or another, like if i have car expenses
155369:39	uh, you do not have, uh, uh, family available or family that --n400352's, uh,
155386:3	or to rehab after, uh, an illness.
155454:77	so that, that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the, uh, either medicare or insurance --n401efb to cover it.
155471:71	unfortunately, some elderly have to go to or have, i guess it's --n402428 alzheimer's or where they wonder or, or, uh, confused or have some mental problem --n402477.
155471:96	unfortunately, some elderly have to go to or have, i guess it's --n402428 alzheimer's or where they wonder or, or, uh, confused or have some mental problem --n402477.
155471:111	unfortunately, some elderly have to go to or have, i guess it's --n402428 alzheimer's or where they wonder or, or, uh, confused or have some mental problem --n402477.
155506:58	and, uh, she really enjoys it right now because she doesn't have --n4031e7 to wash dishes or cook.
155706:63	you know, when when you work at a company --n403a76 whether you know it or not, is that you're categorized --n403aad.
155707:90	some people --n403be0 can be let --n403bf3 go and replaced --n403c06 like, uh, say, uh, a typist, uh, somebody who --n403c49 does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist.
155707:100	some people --n403be0 can be let --n403bf3 go and replaced --n403c06 like, uh, say, uh, a typist, uh, somebody who --n403c49 does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist.
155785:58	and we seem --n401be0 to be able --n401bf3 to get along with the president turnover ever eight years or four years.
155799:32	a term limitation for congress would be like three terms or even four terms
155800:3	or you would increase the length of the, of each term of a congressman.
155847:3	or is it the f b i.
155861:103	but i, i think that there are, there are advantages to having seniority and, uh, turn-, or, not having a complete turnover every, some small number of years.
155943:15	and muffler falls off or something
155977:76	and i know that's not due to, uh, it's not due to, to gasoline or to, you know, carbon monoxide so much as the c f c --s
156031:14	or, or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to the way, where we got to --n402e37.
156117:69	i mean, it, it definitely it's not at a level comparable to los angeles or denver
156143:17	i also read one or two papers a day
156148:29	so, when you say the morning news, or evening news or national news --n4003e0 is when.
156148:36	so, when you say the morning news, or evening news or national news --n4003e0 is when.
156153:26	well, i would probably be a junkie or s-, watch c n n a lot,
156188:54	and i also try and read one of the, uh, major dailies like the chicago tribune, or the new york times or something like that.
156188:65	and i also try and read one of the, uh, major dailies like the chicago tribune, or the new york times or something like that.
156203:108	but, uh, and when you read a lot of this stuff --n401b7e, the, the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so,
156208:29	but i swear it's at least second or third grade, sometimes.
156216:41	uh, i think if you listen to like n p r or something like,
156230:27	instead of --n402547 being, as your newspaper or your t v news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb --n4025a6, they go really in depth on topics which i think --n4025dd is good.
156230:60	instead of --n402547 being, as your newspaper or your t v news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb --n4025a6, they go really in depth on topics which i think --n4025dd is good.
156250:14	had that invasion or whatever it is --n402c18.
156317:102	all we, all i do --n40034d is, uh, keep a list of things like debts that --n400388 are outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent --n4003eb that month,
156354:25	i don't really have this major budget or anything.
156428:3	or,
156479:48	i, i don't trust myself with --n40366d using a calculator or computer, y-, too much stuff like that because i want --n4036c0 to make sure that, that i, i keep on top of the numbers and understand what --n40371f's going on.
156496:47	and i always call in and, like, once every other week or so
156661:22	anyway, i dealt with two or three kids --n403089 today that --n403098 are going --n4030a7 to end up where somebody has, making a decision what to do --n4030e6 with them --n4030f5.
156857:70	uh, so do, do you think it --n403567's more important to spend money on research or for support of, uh, people.
156862:114	uh, i think, i think one of the main things that --n4037cb's really important to spend money on --n4037f6 is education, not support or, or, research per se, but, but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed --n403871 out of the work place and out of society, you know, kind of like lepers would --n4038c4 you know
156906:44	committing them mostly is, you know, either crimes of passion or at the moment
156907:3	or they think they're not going --n400bfe to get caught --n400c11
156908:3	or,
156928:23	one, one way or another.
156982:71	w-, w-, we're going --n403126 to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something.
156987:88	but you look at our, our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to, to like texas or someplace that --n403335 does, you know, it, it, it --n403378's impossible to make a case that it's, it's affecting it in any way.
157011:154	and, you know, i, i think when you listen to like the, uh, the, the victims' families and things --n403f08, they're always talking about, you know, uh, --n403f3f feeling justified or feeling, you know, like they've gotten something out of it,
157012:72	i mean, my thought has been, once the guy has been imprisoned --n404221, if he goes to jail forever or whatever, if he gets killed --n404260, it shouldn't make any difference to the, uh, the victim's family.
157037:38	and why, does it just turn out --n404db9 to be genetic or biochemical in origin --n404ddc.
157164:135	uh, i think i'd like --n4020c0 to get, uh, b m w or if i go the german route, which i'm kind of leaning towards --n40212f right now, but, uh, or maybe a, hon-, i mean, a, a acura legend.
157176:48	i haven't really determined if i like the, the japanese or the, if i like them enough to purchase one..
157389:42	and basically, uh, we were going --n402cb3 to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax.
157431:41	i'm not going --n403ed3 to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs.
157446:19	up until, like, eighty-five or something was the,
157474:125	and i, i don't think it --n401077 would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if, you know, six or seven voted not guilty, then instead of it being a hung jury, that was an acquittal.
157505:206	well, the people i know --n40242e who --n402439 have served have said that usually what --n40245c ends up --n40246b happening is that, you know, after initially finding out where people stand --n4024ae, that the whole deliberation usually results, if there is a, you know, something like a nine, three or, or more severe and, and the people in the majority trying --n40255d to convince the minority that they're right
157511:153	well, the, the one thing that i know --n402ae2 does seem --n402af1 to happen from people i've talked to --n402b1c on this, is that in the situation you just said --n402b53 where it's nine to three, or some such number --n402b86, that there's, an effect --n402bad starts --n402bb8 being that there's starts --n402bd3 being a lot of peer pressure going on
157526:224	some of them did say that, you know, when they were the only one left opposing the verdict --n403672, uh, you know, everyone was getting on them so, so heavily that eventually they just gave in --n4036cd knowing that nothing they could do --n4036f0 could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for --n403733 or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict.
157550:50	wendy, i guess we get --n40002e to talk about budgets --n400045 --n40004c tonight or lack of budgets if, uh, if that may be the case and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that, uh,
157550:122	wendy, i guess we get --n40002e to talk about budgets --n400045 --n40004c tonight or lack of budgets if, uh, if that may be the case and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that, uh,
157555:48	do you have a, uh, budget, or a monthly budget, or a long term budget that you stick to --n400356.
157586:22	so i don't get any overtime or anything like that
157597:36	and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going --n40133f to spend --n40134e and set that money aside,
157607:95	and we find out that, you know, no matter what kind of budget you stick on --n4018bf, there's always going --n4018da to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house, that you have --n401925 to have money --n401938 for --n401943 and, uh, not enough to go and to take a loan out, but, uh, you have --n4019a2 to have money for --n4019b9.
157948:33	i, i think working mothers or mothers who --n402642 choose --n40264d to work outside the home, um, need very early --n402680 to come to grips with any guilt, that they feel --n4026b3 and decide what --n4026c6's best for them and their family.
158063:82	but, um, he said that he would, he would want --n400c13 to, to seriously hurt --n400c3a or if not kill --n400c51 someone if, if they did something to his wife.
158077:187	and i think that the people who --n401771 are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level. uh, you know, whether it be a biblical force, uh, you know, the eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a knife, life type logic or just, uh, uh, some sort of anger at putting peop-, putting, uh, murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life, uh, while we foot the bill.
158084:70	are they reformatories, where we're trying --n402099 to take people who --n4020b0 can't survive or, or that, that --n4020f3 aren't conforming enough to society so that, that we work well together --n402132.
158120:23	like say some young kids or something like that that --n403756 might be inclined more towards a life of crime, had --n403789 to sit and watch and, and see a guy burn or, or, you know, something or shot --n4037f0 by a firing squad or something like that.
158120:131	like say some young kids or something like that that --n403756 might be inclined more towards a life of crime, had --n403789 to sit and watch and, and see a guy burn or, or, you know, something or shot --n4037f0 by a firing squad or something like that.
158120:151	like say some young kids or something like that that --n403756 might be inclined more towards a life of crime, had --n403789 to sit and watch and, and see a guy burn or, or, you know, something or shot --n4037f0 by a firing squad or something like that.
158120:170	like say some young kids or something like that that --n403756 might be inclined more towards a life of crime, had --n403789 to sit and watch and, and see a guy burn or, or, you know, something or shot --n4037f0 by a firing squad or something like that.
158123:56	well, i, i don't know if that would really work that way or not.
158144:58	and that is, uh, and that is the exclusion of jurors because of --n400821 or in spite of --n400838 their race. uh,
158194:80	the whole, the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or, or, or, uh, let go based on whether, or not the person, whether or not the evidence says, that there's enough,
158194:134	the whole, the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or, or, or, uh, let go based on whether, or not the person, whether or not the evidence says, that there's enough,
158308:59	and this is supposed --n4003c2 to be a very well-known center here in tyler who --n4003f1 had two or three, um, centers, all over, you know, the, um, city
158400:148	it sounds like --n402354 to me your, your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people.. affectionate people that they're, they're kind of par-, may be parents themselves or something.
158472:34	in fact, it was called --n403d9c humpty dumpty play school or something,
158554:133	but on the other hand, you know, if they would have had a hard time --n4015f0 retaliating because the, you know, they, they wouldn't have been given --n40163f access to the friend or foe codes.
158655:3	or what do yo-,
158707:85	and, um, y-, there's so many people who --n400ab0 want a, a dib of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is --n400afb
158707:94	and, um, y-, there's so many people who --n400ab0 want a, a dib of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is --n400afb
158743:3	or are you, did you go directly from high school into, into college.
158754:25	have you like worked on political action committees or something like that.
158857:36	are you like in the particle, particle research or anything like that
158858:3	or is it more, um, applied physics.
158894:3	or maybe it was on the radi-,
158937:24	we don't really have any vacation or, you know, sick days or health care or anything really
158937:43	we don't really have any vacation or, you know, sick days or health care or anything really
158937:50	we don't really have any vacation or, you know, sick days or health care or anything really
159063:170	i have, so i have --n403288 to take that into consideration when i evaluate like how much i get paid --n4032c7 --n4032ce real --n4032d9, you know, because if i was working somewhere else i'd have --n403318 to, you know, pay an extra five percent, or so.
159108:25	you know juries will decide the guilt or innocence,
159146:81	you know some of the health insurance is written --n401659 that way. you know, that, uh, if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy, you know, it s-, pre specified in the policy so much
159200:22	one of their employees causes damage or something.
159208:3	or how does that work --n403050.
159315:41	they're not completely up on what --n401173 should be going on or what --n401192's not going on.
159321:28	and she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died.
159334:42	and, you know, it --n401735 was very difficult for either them or my grandfather to take care of her since she was, uh, you know, could not do very much for herself after the stroke.
159394:8	either that or they're just so understaffed that they can't afford --n402f34 to put in the, uh, care that they need --n402f67. cause it's, you know,
159476:33	and i haven't really gone out, and bought any or listened to much on the, on the radio except for classical
159598:65	i'm surprised you didn't go to, to any pa-, parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff --n402461
159598:96	i'm surprised you didn't go to, to any pa-, parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff --n402461
159599:3	or,
159728:52	do you like, uh, like v-, van halen or anything like that.
159806:82	and, uh, she's gotten some, uh, she's been on like the top ten, i guess --n40573e, or whatever.
159844:66	and then the rest is whatever you want --n400934 to put --n400943 in. if you put more than that or something like that.
159858:39	it's like hundred bucks a, a month or something for a family.
159863:166	huh, well, i guess what we have --n400f3c is like a f-, what they call --n400f6b a flex benefits plan where you, you get like a certain amount of dollars and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need --n400fea --n400ff1.
159864:98	otherwise you can, uh, guess you can put, also put money, hold money back and then either use or lose it and that doesn't get taxed --n4012bd or can just have that money, you know, put --n4012f0 in your paycheck.
159864:126	otherwise you can, uh, guess you can put, also put money, hold money back and then either use or lose it and that doesn't get taxed --n4012bd or can just have that money, you know, put --n4012f0 in your paycheck.
159867:30	we have one of those use it or lose it plans --n401558, too, where, uh, they'll basically pay for, uh, you know, child care type, uh, expenses --n4015c3.
159871:49	it's, uh, it saves a third off on taxes or something.
159933:19	so you work for bell or something like that.
160000:141	and, uh, i guess, uh, first and foremost, it, really it's a question of what --n4002be the student wants --n4002d1 to have --n4002e0 in the way of a career and then, uh, uh, which colleges or universities --n40032b can best offer that program,
160003:12	it's whether or not you're a resident for that jurisdiction,
160004:3	or you know, it does,
160018:109	uh, the one, the one thing that i, you know, i'd advise any parent, uh, you know, or any, or any person looking for a college --n400b04, uh, is that i think, i think, you know, it --n400b4b's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from, you know, the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the, you know, actual students there
160080:77	uh, whether you, you know, in one sense, whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a, a spirit of, somewhat unkind, but producing graduates.
160190:51	during the winter time i think --n40111e they, they move south or something
160240:78	if i, if see a, s-, if i see a pile of cans or bottles or something i'll throw it in there,
160240:82	if i, if see a, s-, if i see a pile of cans or bottles or something i'll throw it in there,
160310:27	and i'm not sure if kroger does or not
160313:28	they'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic.
160313:32	they'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic.
160358:18	they treat it with chemicals or something.
160448:28	i just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts --n4002f1 to talk about it.
160470:49	and, uh, don't listen to the radio --n400c5b too much especially the news channels or anything like that, you know,
160471:34	they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened
160498:3	or they're making, making time because they to fill in an hour's worth of news.
160515:34	listen to the news --n401fd9 to hear the traffic report or something.
160541:33	i mean, it's only been, three months or something like that since that happened
160614:25	do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that.
160657:8	tax free or die.
160728:37	and also, you know, then you figure out seven or eight percent for f i c a which --n401bba is taxes where you,
160767:43	so much of it, is now just going --n402b31 to service debt or you know, is going in, into, into programs that, you know,
160808:39	i mean, i just read something that, two thirds or three quarters, i'm not exactly sure of our national debt are, was created --n403f67 during the reagan bush --n403f7e era who --n403f8d are suppo-, supposedly fiscally conservative.
160900:17	is it a miniature --n400238 or a standard --n40024b schnauzer.
161187:59	uh, it --n4004f3's, uh, an interesting experience to be a surrogate parent for, or parent for a lot of people there,
161207:19	because somebody has a child or, uh, likes children doesn't really mean that they're qualified --n401171 to give the child the kind of supervision and training that that, uh,
161225:108	and i didn't want --n401bc9 to run an institution where that was the case --n401bf4, where all we were doing --n401c17 were warehousing --n401c26 because the first four, five years or so important
161231:135	when a couple has a child --n4021c7, then they should both take, you say the first four or five years are the most important, and i think i would agree with that, they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting.
161245:43	but then they have --n4029ee to work from age thirty or, or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety.
161245:58	but then they have --n4029ee to work from age thirty or, or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety.
161245:62	but then they have --n4029ee to work from age thirty or, or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety.
161419:72	uh, i feel that, uh, that, that music should take chances in one way or another and that, uh, you know, if you've heard a piece, oh, a hundred, a hundred times,
161492:3	or,
161555:3	or,
161566:15	and that's south or north of there or something.
161566:25	and that's south or north of there or something.
161582:3	or,
161596:3	or,
161633:3	or they just,
161719:3	or,
161772:3	or do you think there's too much crime now.
161811:83	i mean, it seems like our, our, the prison systems, we can't seem --n400e60 to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system.
161811:102	i mean, it seems like our, our, the prison systems, we can't seem --n400e60 to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system.
161920:59	well, see, i always have problems because, because i can never decide whether or not i'm, i'm supposed --n4038ca to be a conservative or, or a liberal
161920:119	well, see, i always have problems because, because i can never decide whether or not i'm, i'm supposed --n4038ca to be a conservative or, or a liberal
161931:92	i mean, i can't help but wonder if, if i grew up without a father, on the streets, and with like little or no money, wouldn't wouldn't i be in prison at this point.
161967:47	is he the guy --n40496c wants --n404977 to, like, deregulate heroin, or something.
162008:3	or, you open to buying foreign cars.
162060:40	so i don't need a, a mini van or such to, uh, haul people around in --n401bba.
162066:17	oh, like a miata or something like that.
162139:49	uh, i've had, uh, i've had one or two american cars i think --n403434,
162164:181	but i think they're obliged --n40405a to have these things because hertz and avis and those folks have it --n404095 in their contract that they can sell it back to g m after, you know, it's, after they've used it for six months and put you know, twelve or fifteen thousand miles, on it
162239:31	and i'm not, like, a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff.
162268:64	and, the best thing, and a lot of the stuff, the best thing is like four years or five years, it's pretty soon, you're completely vested --n400fb5 in the retirement plan and everything,
162314:61	i, i guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that
162314:81	i, i guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that
162373:161	it --n403460's really nice to be, for me, anyway, to be able --n4034a7 to work in, uh, a research atmosphere, uh, where i don't have --n4034f2 to, uh, uh, you know, worry about, uh, academics or anything like that --n403545,
162444:31	uh, d c around here stands for drug capital or death capital.
162491:174	and, uh, nowadays the latest thing i've, i've read about --n40110f in the paper here that they're doing --n401136 as far as, uh, crimes involving stealing cars is that, instead of --n40117d stealing, uh, cars like at night, breaking into them or whatever, they will pick out a car that they want --n4011e4 and wait until you show up, and then as you get out of the car, they just, uh, step up and, uh, take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house.
162497:30	that way there's no damage to the car or anything.
162500:44	they're decided they're completely unworried about --n401957 being identified --n401966 or anything of that sort.
162662:68	well, in a criminal case, say one in which, you know, there is, like, say assault or some such --n401077. i think there ought --n401096 to be a unanimous, uh, vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this.
162663:73	and in civil law there, you know, is such a thing as like, let's say, uh, misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that.
162663:85	and in civil law there, you know, is such a thing as like, let's say, uh, misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that.
162665:33	i don't know if i'm making any sense or not.
162669:3	or,
162681:59	you know, i don't know for, if you're familiar with that or not.
162711:3	or, i think it's a limit now,
162718:32	it was always my impression that the justice himself, or herself, had the final say.
162736:25	well, does it usually make a recording or s-,
162817:63	i, i know a lot of people around here sometimes have, like, mothers or grandmothers that --n40184c take care of their kids
162823:15	you either know them or know somebody who --n401bb1 knows them, --n401bc8 to get --n401bd7 to,
162850:90	and you, and you don't always even know if it's, it's going --n402582 to be the right place or not.
162881:3	or the phone rang or, you know, at the wrong time.
162962:70	and those three guys take the evidence, go off, figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not.
162989:64	you can't use this as, uh, evidence, you know, because it was either illegally obtained --n4013cf or whatever
163049:87	it's kind of like do it, do it in the similar vein similar, like, uh, v c r or television repair.
163053:76	now, if he comes in and says, you know, i'll repair your, your v c r, or somebody else's v c r, for a hundred dollars, gets in there, maybe it's a blown fuse,
163057:69	so, maybe if we did that with the lawyers, so that, you know, whether it's a murder case or a, you know, a civil, uh, somebody suing somebody else, you get x dollars for that case
163113:53	fact as far as i know, the school --n4003a4 doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here. and, uh, or the grocery store or anything in this area,
163113:82	fact as far as i know, the school --n4003a4 doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here. and, uh, or the grocery store or anything in this area,
163113:94	fact as far as i know, the school --n4003a4 doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here. and, uh, or the grocery store or anything in this area,
163150:5	even or,
163160:3	or, do you get money for it.
163276:45	i have no idea how long this is supposed --n403b44 to last --n403b53 or anything.
163278:40	oh, i think, i think two or three minutes is fine.
163335:87	uh, our policies and procedures manual, uh, the furthest it goes --n4006a6 about drugs is in the, kind of the miscellaneous section, or its reasons for immediate dismissal,
163382:73	they've never, you know, they never go out to the, the oil rigs or anything,
163388:53	and then if you get injured --n402329 on the job, if you like trip and fall or something, uh, they give you a drug test right away.
163392:29	other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that,
163402:100	we, that's been an, a, an issue, uh, in our company even though we don't have the random --n4028cf or even regular --n4028e2 drug screening.
163466:25	or, or, or what do you think --n400198.
163481:124	see, i never thought really, it's, uh, i never really thought that, that the, the question really had --n400a01 to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little.
163481:144	see, i never thought really, it's, uh, i never really thought that, that the, the question really had --n400a01 to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little.
163483:22	for instance, like social security tax or soc-, uh,
163492:87	when i, when i see that money taken out of my paycheck each, each week, i, or each, every other week --n401274, i, i really think that money's history
163526:49	and the poor president has, has --n402c5b to, uh, either accept or reject the whole thing.
163545:33	there's a political term for this stuff, pork barrel or something.
163589:3	or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and, and whatnot.
163620:59	i find myself, uh, listening to a lot of, uh, uh, either old timer --n400617 or new england --n40062a, uh, dance bands as well as, uh, just more popular folk music and new artists coming up.
163686:50	i, i don't care for it at all, that texas twang or whatever you want --n401c40 to call it --n401c53.
163718:34	but they're not in it --n40295e to say anything or give a message which --n402985 is what they were do-,
163782:3	or i don't like it
163796:3	or do you just buy along the same artist.
163814:3	or, about the only new music i hear --n404efe is somebody else that i know --n404f1d will buy something new that i haven't heard --n404f48
163866:106	what --n4009eb's more likely --n4009fe to occur is, uh, robbery of, uh, you know, knocking over a, a small store or a car theft, you know, it, things of that nature.
163924:58	it's not like, uh, it's someone do steal a, a or television or v c r or something like that
163924:62	it's not like, uh, it's someone do steal a, a or television or v c r or something like that
163924:71	it's not like, uh, it's someone do steal a, a or television or v c r or something like that
163926:23	you going --n402b70 to get ten or fifteen bucks for it
164042:75	and, uh, you know, v eights seem --n401d12 to be a return to the days of, you know, ten or twelve miles a gallon.
164050:59	but there's so many occasions when i've had --n4021e0 to move some members of the family or do this or that --n402217,
164050:67	but there's so many occasions when i've had --n4021e0 to move some members of the family or do this or that --n402217,
164097:49	one of my sons has a, a plymouth, uh, van or, you know, uh, uh, that same type of thing, the voyager, i guess
164115:3	or is that,
164164:67	have you been, uh, have you been the subject of such a crime, such as stealing, or anything.
164180:99	uh, when i think of crime --n4015ee, i think of stuff that, that --n401615 affects other people like people getting, you know, killed or raped --n401650.
164205:152	what, what do you think --n401eb7 is, uh, is an appropriate, uh, punishment for some of the various, you know, such as, things such as rape or, or, uh, murder or something like that.
164205:167	what, what do you think --n401eb7 is, uh, is an appropriate, uh, punishment for some of the various, you know, such as, things such as rape or, or, uh, murder or something like that.
164263:27	i don't know if it would or not though.
164340:110	and they don't think that, uh, stop and think and say, well, maybe i shouldn't do this, uh, because, uh, i might get the gas chamber or something like that.
164352:51	i think in some cases it --n400973 doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not.
164364:3	or,
164380:21	needs to be punished --n400f5a or, uh, eliminated --n400f75 from society.
164419:42	huh. do you think they should be punished --n401dd7 at all, or, uh, like go to prison, uh,
164502:39	i, i'm in washington, d c or at least very close to it.
164552:52	and occasionally in the morning, i'll pick up something like, uh, c n n or that,
164554:3	or,
164638:72	but, uh, a-, and occasionally i, i pick up like time magazine or something i think --n402e10, uh, if they've got an interesting lead story,
164667:49	and it's just sort of a, you know, four or five pages that --n403abe covers what --n403acd's going on in plano.
164711:79	it gives you a whole different perspective on the news, uh, when you hear it from, say, a european point of view, or from the country of origin --n400952.
164726:14	or, or it's not happening in your backyard
164753:13	the interpretive approach or the straight reporting.
164780:69	they, they want --n40363d to sit down in front of the tv and, uh, or at a, read a magazine or u s a today and read in four paragraphs, uh, and, and find out every-,
164780:101	they, they want --n40363d to sit down in front of the tv and, uh, or at a, read a magazine or u s a today and read in four paragraphs, uh, and, and find out every-,
164811:48	i have friends that --n40072c live in the other --n400743, the less fortunate or whatever you want --n40076a to call it --n40077d --n400784 part of town
164831:3	or not new york city, upstate new york
164864:140	and the, the problem with that is then, then, then people will either, the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away --n40225b to get better schools.
165010:22	it's probably a japanese --n400e7c or a burmese --n400e8f company owning and hiring people in the u s.
165021:46	but, uh, you know, the transmission may be made --n401297 in japan or whatever.
165043:58	the, the days of don't buy a car made on a monday or a friday are pretty much going away
165055:25	but then again you look at a ford or especially a chevy
165073:37	it probably won't start --n402683 really showing up until ninety-four or so.
165157:25	they issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive.
165223:37	and they wanted something like fifteen dollars, uh, a front or something like that
165224:3	or maybe it --n400e32 was thirty dollars to do it
165235:41	and then i can decide whether i want them to do it or whether i can do it, see.
165394:22	do you have a two income family or one income.
165428:56	her, is her career, uh, related to, to finance or accounting.
165670:54	uh, yet i don't know wh-, whether i would buy saturn or not at this point.
165713:53	i, i'd have --n40193c to almost go --n40194f take a class or something like that.
165783:89	actually, my, my wife and i are actually thinking, contemplating --n40326b buying a new car in the next year and a half or so.
165791:28	a dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know.
165795:11	year old ninety-two or something like that.
165815:14	or, or, of course, we've already talked, you know,
165868:35	and they only have one set of recycling bins, one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters.
165876:47	and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably, believe it or not, is just to get the extra nickel at the, uh, the store and not, uh,
165904:205	i think here if they, uh, instead of just, you know, requiring that you put, put out the trash and stuff, if they --n4024cc could get some kind of rebate, those people who --n4024ff do put the stuff out, uh, you know, and separate it, have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate.
165932:19	because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that, uh, trash, uh, the telephone books are the type of thing that --n4039bc don't break down over a long period of time.
166028:3	or do you think that we're, we're, uh, all trying --n401ac3 to keep up with a certain standard of living.
166034:3	or,
166389:3	or,
166412:46	but it's not going --n4033bd to be wide spread super bowl and every sunday afternoon or anything, you know.
166446:3	or australian rules football.
166593:34	once i found out that that's really not necessary or legal then i just refuse
166599:24	i'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all.
166616:60	and nowhere does it say you h-, asks you whether you have permission --n4013ae or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone.
166616:81	and nowhere does it say you h-, asks you whether you have permission --n4013ae or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone.
166635:51	but, uh, i don't know if that's been challenged --n401c2b in the courts or not.
166652:28	and you start --n4026ab getting millions of calls or solicitations.
166661:21	like, uh, national public radio or any of these, the public, uh, stations, you know.
166692:63	and they actually happen --n4033cd to be people who --n4033e4 are, graduated in your class or something like that.
166786:69	because i think what they often get used --n401c61 as --n401c6c is, uh, almost like a very high level or long-term care for, uh, similar to a hospital.
166792:32	often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or alzheimer's disease or those or, or physical and mental handicaps. uh, you know, where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind. even though it may be minimal --n4022d1.
166792:65	often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or alzheimer's disease or those or, or physical and mental handicaps. uh, you know, where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind. even though it may be minimal --n4022d1.
166827:24	i think it's, four or five,
166837:26	i think i have a severe demeanor or something.
166883:30	the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever,
166883:46	the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever,
166903:128	matter of fact, i've heard that, i've heard that some of the information --n402324, uh, is prevented --n40233f from --n40234a reaching the jury, like, uh, mitigating circumstances or, or preceding, uh, criminal record or things of this nature that,
166903:147	matter of fact, i've heard that, i've heard that some of the information --n402324, uh, is prevented --n40233f from --n40234a reaching the jury, like, uh, mitigating circumstances or, or preceding, uh, criminal record or things of this nature that,
166916:31	during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do --n402c01 with their background.
166934:41	so you got --n403389 to give them either more time in the system or a different process that --n4033c8 will hopefully work better.
166935:78	when it comes down to things like alternative sentencing --n4034df, i'm all for that for, uh, small crimes, infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that --n403542 have gone to warrant,
166935:87	when it comes down to things like alternative sentencing --n4034df, i'm all for that for, uh, small crimes, infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that --n403542 have gone to warrant,
166963:23	and whe-, whether or not you agree with that law, i-, you're still circumventing it.
166971:95	um, s-, s-, naturally some, some things you just can't find --n400d8b in your local k-mart or, or, uh, bryn mawr stereo dealer.
167079:57	like for petty, for theft and, and stuff like that or manslaughter, you know, i don't think they should do that.
167133:46	now, are they, are they rehabilitative or, or not.
167164:56	and, of course, now, you know, and you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process
167174:9	one way or another we're now recording.
167272:34	it wasn't, you know, like a commercial project or something.
167304:37	and they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something.
167343:8	triple glaze or double glaze or,
167343:15	triple glaze or double glaze or,
167584:12	or or how do you work that --n403832.
167596:3	or i can just carry it over.
167629:61	as far as like big things like something comes up and you have --n4045d9 to buy a t v or a big item, like for the house.
167649:52	recently graduated from high school. meaning like, uh, you know, three or four years ago.
167686:53	it was a, a, it's a more or less a suburban school system.
167733:135	i, i, i mean i just can't even picture how that could happen. you know, except maybe to someone who --n402392's, you know, really badly learning, uh, disabled or something --n4023d1.
167932:24	they'll set up like a trap or something like that in some sense.
168058:197	and she, and, and what she said --n401b58 that, that generally, the problems that people have --n401b93 with being environmentally conscious is number one, they don't want it to change their lifestyle and, and like, you know, especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything.
168058:206	and she, and, and what she said --n401b58 that, that generally, the problems that people have --n401b93 with being environmentally conscious is number one, they don't want it to change their lifestyle and, and like, you know, especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything.
168082:8	uh, or you can have bundles up to a certain weight, and cer-, certain dimensions, tie them up and put them by the curb.
168105:64	and you know, and, and if you've got, uh, food containers or anything like that, it's a big problem.
168172:31	and they just add it on to your water bill or something.
168175:18	are you north of sarasota or, east,
168297:182	when i, uh, was in, uh, undergraduate school a long, long time ago --n40193c, i, uh, noted that the monthly salary, starting average monthly salary salary for engineers that, you know, in my discipline, was like oh, six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that.
168438:37	i've never had a, a punishment or a, a crime like a murder touch my immediate family
168510:23	they don't execute anybody in britain or france
168511:31	and i don't believe they do in germany or italy either
168545:138	the other thing that --n4030e6 bothers me is when it becomes a political issue --n403111 because i don't really think it, uh, i don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else.
168545:147	the other thing that --n4030e6 bothers me is when it becomes a political issue --n403111 because i don't really think it, uh, i don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else.
168654:33	do you keep your kids, uh, active in sports or anything
168655:3	or,
168755:23	oh, i probably spend an hour or two.
168838:150	and if they're, you know, if they're on some kind of, you know, contol-, controlled substance then, you know, it kinds of takes away from the job of, you know, the supervisor or manager type person, you know, who --n401df4 is able --n401e03 to evaluate them.
168855:104	i mean i've heard of things like, you know, making them, you know, marking them somehow or, you know, or something like that or, you know, putting them all someplace like in a kind of,
168855:119	i mean i've heard of things like, you know, making them, you know, marking them somehow or, you know, or something like that or, you know, putting them all someplace like in a kind of,
168860:102	wel-, i guess it kind of borders on where, i mean what do you value --n402c0d more. the invasion of, uh, the person's privacy or the possible danger to, you know, other people.
168929:25	either you have, uh, military service or some sort of alternative, nonmilitary service for a few years.
168937:102	and, so, uh, one of the things that --n400f47 would fulfill the, at least the nominal, uh, qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft.
168961:3	or, uh,
168970:109	uh, kind of in lieu of the draft for, for people who --n401827 don't, uh, who, you know, --n40185a are conscientious objectors or don't otherwise want e-, e-, to be in the military, you know.
168972:3	or you can do this other thing for one or two years --n401ba7 to kind of serve the community and, and learn about things.
168972:28	or you can do this other thing for one or two years --n401ba7 to kind of serve the community and, and learn about things.
168977:140	and they have, uh, you know, in, in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can say, they can see that, you know, if i do something or sub-, submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever, at least for a short period of time, i can accomplish a lot
168977:185	and they have, uh, you know, in, in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can say, they can see that, you know, if i do something or sub-, submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever, at least for a short period of time, i can accomplish a lot
169005:87	well, it depends on whether you, whether we figure that we have that we have a defense oriented military or an aggressive, aggression oriented military.
169082:3	or,
169316:26	and anything i participated in --n400fb0 or know about --n400fc3 when i read about it in the paper --n400fea is always so, uh, covered --n40100d from such a funny and superficial perspective that i don't have much confidence in it.
169332:97	and the view that i would rather take --n401ab1 is that there's a different amount of information you need --n401ae8 when you're particularly interested in a topic or, uh, particularly interested in --n401b2b buying something as a, you know as a hobbyist --n401b5a versus when you want --n401b71 to go out and buy a blender because you need --n401ba0 to mix things --n401bb3.
169350:140	if you were deeply involved in it, then you immediately realize that what they print --n40223a is stuff that you probably knew --n402259 already and the stuff that you want --n40227c they're not printing --n402293 because the average person doesn't need or want --n4022be to know that much.
169391:49	something that you cared about --n4037b7 happened, you'd find out from friends or other channels.
169397:8	clarence thomas or,
169498:45	uh, whether they, they decide whether or not they, uh, the accused or whatever would get the, uh, get the death penalty.
169498:76	uh, whether they, they decide whether or not they, uh, the accused or whatever would get the, uh, get the death penalty.
169514:73	the, uh, governor, you know, has been trying --n401a67 to decide whether he's going --n401a86 to commute it or not.
169551:32	i think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years.
169577:50	i think in like, uh, lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six, whatever. how ever many --n402ffb is on, sitting on a jury.
169593:30	and, uh, they've only deliberated four hours or, something
169603:29	i'm telling you, go one way or the other.
169669:37	uh, have you every been tested --n400068 for a new job or anything.
169721:3	or they would tell you.
169728:27	because you should be given --n401752 another chance or at least be able --n401775 to justify it or something.
169728:54	because you should be given --n401752 another chance or at least be able --n401775 to justify it or something.
169739:38	and i think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time.
169798:47	if someone was out --n4033bf to get you, i think that a company or a boss could use this.
169799:43	you know, they could keep on --n4034e5 doing this to you or something, i guess --n403514.
169818:51	i mean a lot of, a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of --n403b21 later on
169844:73	but if you had, if you had, uh, parents say or, or, or th-, grandparents, whatever it is --n400481, uh, who --n400498 were ready, who, who you thought --n4004c3 might benefit from a nursing home, what do you think you would look for --n40050a.
169940:25	there's nothing, maybe a picture or two that --n404022 belongs to that person
169950:101	i used --n404880 to initially think that the only people who --n4048a7 went into such residences were people who, uh, --n4048d6 were adequately deficient in their abilities, uh physical or mental, that they couldn't take care of themselves.
170074:84	and it, that i, i don't know if i ever went as far as three months --n4026cd or not i-, i-, in --n4026fc keeping that kind of data.
170075:29	i certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever.
170132:31	but for me, i only do that every week or, without even, i mean, maybe once a month.
170139:15	so it's six or seven dollars.
170155:23	do you work for a big --n4000ea or a little --n4000fd place.
170170:62	the area i work in --n4005db, it, it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so.
170245:28	so there should be something --n402725 in there or some kind of clause that --n40274c will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, you know, uh, neglect or something like that.
170245:105	so there should be something --n402725 in there or some kind of clause that --n40274c will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, you know, uh, neglect or something like that.
170249:63	you know. because it --n40294b's not a person's fault that, you know, people not buying or businesses are, are not on the up and up all the time, you know.
170250:24	i don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or two, but, you know, a number of people can, can be the downfall of com-, a company situation --n402bcb.
170250:40	i don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or two, but, you know, a number of people can, can be the downfall of com-, a company situation --n402bcb.
170266:3	or,
170320:16	they're in college or just out of college
170371:33	and he was treated --n4010af like he had five fathers or something.
170407:21	and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that.
170411:19	if you have one child or fewer, you get involved --n401f45 in organized events or activities
170411:45	if you have one child or fewer, you get involved --n401f45 in organized events or activities
170660:30	and that's happened to me more than once or twice. jus-, just, just about every time i've went in somewhere --n402b97.
170713:59	do you know anyone that, uh, --n400032 is, is in a nursing home or has ever been in one.
170761:74	i don't know whether that's because they, you know, sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the, the reason is --n4018a4.
170762:68	but i think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home --n401a3c is only like six months or something.
170776:46	if, if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that --n401e18 can take care of you, then you stay where you are --n401e4f.
170867:118	i guess, uh, the only rule, uh, i can think of --n4004d9 is that i like --n4004f0 to look for places with, uh, good respectable, nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that.
170867:125	i guess, uh, the only rule, uh, i can think of --n4004d9 is that i like --n4004f0 to look for places with, uh, good respectable, nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that.
170868:28	if they're associated --n400703 with a college or a university, they're usually a pretty good bet.
170872:72	uh, i think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want --n400842 when you buy a car or refrigerator something --n400869.
170891:107	aren't don't they kind of use them for, everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs. for their per-, for their pet theories or some such thing.
170900:60	i suppose, uh, if you're, if there is a psychology department or an education department around, you might find you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another,
170900:129	i suppose, uh, if you're, if there is a psychology department or an education department around, you might find you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another,
170952:61	and even, even though my wife wasn't working, we did have, uh, one or another of the boys in, uh, child care for part-ti-, just for part of the day. uh, or a couple of days a week just so that, uh, other things could get done --n402851 around the house and so on,
170952:132	and even, even though my wife wasn't working, we did have, uh, one or another of the boys in, uh, child care for part-ti-, just for part of the day. uh, or a couple of days a week just so that, uh, other things could get done --n402851 around the house and so on,
170957:97	i think my wife is much better --n402b57 than i am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not
170974:61	and so i'm just grateful that we don't have --n4030c5 to worry so much about my working or not.
171153:15	when is this good or not good --n402f8f.
171201:237	but a lot of time i-, a lot of cases, uh, is circumstantial evidence that, that --n40021a convicts a person, which i don't think --n400249 is all the time good. because sometimes it --n400274's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent, i mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have an eyewitness.
171205:49	so you think if, if trials were held --n400747 by judges or experts, that they, they would tend --n400786 not to, uh, admit, not to convict people on circumstantial evidence.
171214:55	the trials are held --n400b9a by a panel of three, uh, three or four judges who --n400bd5 are,
171235:79	uh, well, actually i think in most criminal cases it --n4013ad wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury.
171250:3	or, uh,
171264:74	well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom, i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent.
171282:127	but i guess, i guess i like the system that they have --n402cdd in some places where the defendant gets --n402d00 to choose whether he's, goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets --n402d4b to choose it --n402d5e.
171296:160	but, the thing is too, maybe they need more of a, i don't know, more of a expert types to, to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, joe blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever an-, and call them in.
171296:175	but, the thing is too, maybe they need more of a, i don't know, more of a expert types to, to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, joe blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever an-, and call them in.
171322:32	put-, putting on a act or whatever.
171432:56	i didn't even know the person --n40251c's name that --n40252f had given me the hard time or anything
171499:49	uh, the, uh, way back, what, twelve years ago or something when i got my first computer --n400262, i did what everybody else does --n400285, which --n400294 is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks, and, you know, checkbooks and all this kind of thing
171507:54	uh, and i only update that, oh i don't know, maybe once every quarter or so. every three months. just, basically when the statements come in --n400ad1. you know. --n400ae8 just to see whether or not we're falling, you know, getting ahead, falling behind or staying even or what.
171507:124	uh, and i only update that, oh i don't know, maybe once every quarter or so. every three months. just, basically when the statements come in --n400ad1. you know. --n400ae8 just to see whether or not we're falling, you know, getting ahead, falling behind or staying even or what.
171507:175	uh, and i only update that, oh i don't know, maybe once every quarter or so. every three months. just, basically when the statements come in --n400ad1. you know. --n400ae8 just to see whether or not we're falling, you know, getting ahead, falling behind or staying even or what.
171507:183	uh, and i only update that, oh i don't know, maybe once every quarter or so. every three months. just, basically when the statements come in --n400ad1. you know. --n400ae8 just to see whether or not we're falling, you know, getting ahead, falling behind or staying even or what.
171530:129	so it's a lot, it --n401212's very hard on a nonfixed income because i don't know how many days i'm going --n401261 to be called --n401274 in --n40127f and whether i am --n40129a or not, to try --n4012b9 to keep track of finances.
171537:33	and then anything extra is, you know, more or less split --n40171d up between all of us. and just thrown --n401748 in the kitty, more or less, for a rainy day.
171537:86	and then anything extra is, you know, more or less split --n40171d up between all of us. and just thrown --n401748 in the kitty, more or less, for a rainy day.
171559:34	and, uh, i have --n401f90 to balance, more or less, what i get --n401fbf from the state with my bills and, uh, you know, try --n401ffe to work as many days as possible. any time they call me in --n402041.
171606:61	actually, it was a subsidiary of a, of an outfit called u s shoe or something.
171638:3	or,
171646:41	you know, i keep track of every penny. and, more or less, enter it in.
171662:3	or i mean,
171768:114	and that's suppose --n401ec2 to be some of the, uh, the male bonding and the, and the, uh, the male instincts, i guess --n401f3d, or something about the, uh,
171908:16	there's about six or eight guys that --n4042e6 we use --n4042f5 to go out for these games.
171916:24	you go, you know three or four hours before the game.
172063:142	but i think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to, to clients unless they feel they can, you know, tweak a jury into per-, --n402ab3 giving a different sentence or possibly, if it's a civil case, giving higher, uh, you know, awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the, the award.
172063:200	but i think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to, to clients unless they feel they can, you know, tweak a jury into per-, --n402ab3 giving a different sentence or possibly, if it's a civil case, giving higher, uh, you know, awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the, the award.
172120:63	bu-, well you can tell i haven't been in too many juries, judges chambers or anything like that.
172173:55	so i, i don't know if that varies from state to state or if it,
172194:58	i've found that most of homework assignments mumblex really require some sort of computer, uh, simulation or analysis,
172227:42	so i can, like, check up on the weather around the country or whatever which --n401321 is a hobby.
172264:108	i mean, obviously, i do most of my, almost all of my report writing on, on my computer, uh, whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments.
172438:59	uh, probably m-, less so --n40253a now than it was ten years ago or whatever
172573:3	or, uh, uh, uh, pretax savings was another thing that i think --n40143f is a a great, a great benefit mumblex.
172604:53	do they e-, even, do they have father leaves or anything like that.
172615:77	uh, uh, i really think that we need --n40270a to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks --n40274d.
172822:16	at thirty-three hundred dollars or thirty-five hundred dollars i'm paying --n4034c5 in taxes, why i, i could go down to bulverde and probably rent a, rent a house for that, right.
172832:48	course i don't know whether i want --n4038c6 to go to bulverde --n4038dd or not, you know or seguin or someplace like that.
172832:65	course i don't know whether i want --n4038c6 to go to bulverde --n4038dd or not, you know or seguin or someplace like that.
172832:70	course i don't know whether i want --n4038c6 to go to bulverde --n4038dd or not, you know or seguin or someplace like that.
172843:32	i'm, i'm five or six mumblex years before i'm eligible --n404210 to retire
172861:23	and they have no children in school or, you know, anything now.
173001:38	i've had eleven people in it before. believe it or not.
173101:77	i, i mean, the only thing i think i might get --n403b90, a new car or, not necessarily a new car but, a, another car,
173194:3	or,
173411:18	and then they have naps or rest period.
173415:33	and, uh, i think either send them home or do something a little more interesting.
173455:167	and they, uh, they, i think --n400bb5, extend beyond the normal, uh, appeal process. uh, you know, and just drag these, this guy, uh, his, his, uh, ultimate, uh, demise out for ten or fifteen years.
173464:69	well i think that currently the way the law stands --n401538 isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not,
173483:17	uh, but or whether there's just, you know, a policeman has just made a, uh, a, you know, a non, a noncritical error, though be it not the right way to do it --n402423
173496:3	or you became a ward of somebody
173504:75	and if you don't you'll perish. either by the hand of your, your, your master or by --n403924 being pushed --n403933 out in the woods.
173510:113	well, it seems like, well it, it seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried --n403f78 or wrongly punished --n403f8b,
173522:124	uh, a lot of companies now are, are using, uh, drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to, to root out the, the either, uh, elementary or intermediate or advanced, uh, drug users.
173522:128	uh, a lot of companies now are, are using, uh, drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to, to root out the, the either, uh, elementary or intermediate or advanced, uh, drug users.
173549:65	of course, if he's fallen in love with drugs and there isn't anything but getting stoned or high is, is the only thing in life that --n4012f6 seems --n401301 to be meaningful, then maybe there is no hope.
173565:96	uh, you know, we've had, i guess --n4020c0, laws against, uh, you know, various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years, i guess.
173571:116	well i think, uh, the dr-, the laws on, uh, uh, uh, the first morphine laws were, were like ninety, or nineteen ten or nineteen five, something like that.
173574:29	so, ei-, eighty years or so.
173580:217	it's, it --n40266f's hard to, i guess, for me to justify what --n4026ba so-, seems like, you know, basically a breach of the first amen-, you know, freedom from, uh, search and seizure, you know, uh, on something that --n40275d may --n402768 or may not stand as a law, you know, fifty years --n4027a3 from now or even twenty or ten,
173580:263	it's, it --n40266f's hard to, i guess, for me to justify what --n4026ba so-, seems like, you know, basically a breach of the first amen-, you know, freedom from, uh, search and seizure, you know, uh, on something that --n40275d may --n402768 or may not stand as a law, you know, fifty years --n4027a3 from now or even twenty or ten,
173580:269	it's, it --n40266f's hard to, i guess, for me to justify what --n4026ba so-, seems like, you know, basically a breach of the first amen-, you know, freedom from, uh, search and seizure, you know, uh, on something that --n40275d may --n402768 or may not stand as a law, you know, fifty years --n4027a3 from now or even twenty or ten,
173593:128	you know, they, they support drug habits with, uh, with, uh, you know, with things like, uh, you know, burglary or, or prostitution or stuff like that,
173593:136	you know, they, they support drug habits with, uh, with, uh, you know, with things like, uh, you know, burglary or, or prostitution or stuff like that,
173602:32	you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what, ten or twenty dollars an ounce.
173668:99	i don't have any, you know, love lost for people who --n4058db are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff.
173701:143	so you're saying that the taxpayer who --n400d13 also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of, uh, real estate or other taxes
173714:78	uh, people are, uh, reluctant --n401724 to pass, uh, school tax levies even, uh, when the money is needed --n40176f or would be well spent --n40178a because it's, uh, they don't have kids in the schools.
173724:140	and by definition, for some of us, at least, the public good includes having an educated populace and then idea that, uh, you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes in the, at the local level or bigger votes at the national level.
173822:55	but whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever, telling them stories or reading to them.
173822:71	but whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever, telling them stories or reading to them.
173993:39	but if you have a problem with what we did --n4039ef or how we did it --n403a0a, you can always come back and talk to me about it.
174037:32	and, you know, the younger kids, uh, or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another.
174037:62	and, you know, the younger kids, uh, or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another.
174072:59	uh, i guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that --n4001ea or how we would change it --n400209.
174107:42	and there's always that, that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason, you know.
174189:47	you i always think about --n4024b8 watching the people's court or something. and how weird those cases get --n4024f7.
174254:56	i wonder, i wonder how, how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and say --n403741 where i am --n403754 in minneapolis --n403763.
174263:27	and the rest of the country is not or something like that.
174455:39	the only commitments that they're interested in --n402e1b making --n402e26 or even talking about --n402e3d are ones for flash value like, uh, the trip to mars. which --n402e80 is, would, would produce some useful scientific research and so forth,
174537:17	recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever.
174537:24	recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever.
174581:58	and, of course, you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money --n401033 keeping people in jail or not.
174623:107	and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system, you know. because they figure well, you know, sure i, i get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something.
174623:122	and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system, you know. because they figure well, you know, sure i, i get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something.
174625:55	if i, if i elicit good behavior i'm out in maybe five or ten.
174743:3	or is it a life sentence.
174752:20	or death before the firing squad or whatever.
174820:3	or else they would have said something.
174845:49	they test you, uh, before they, before you start or before you even interview
174849:3	or,
174875:45	then do they give you like one ch-, one more chance or two more chances.
174888:3	or,
174932:86	and while i don't do any drugs myself, i've seen some people who --n403d83 work there, uh, you know, smoking a joint or whatever.
175063:135	and when you have two kids in that class that --n401dc9 constantly keeps ca-, the class in an uproar and you're not at liberty --n401e18 to do something about it, other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office --n401e77. it it, you know, it can, it can really be bad.
175101:28	you don't want --n402bfa to seem racist or prejudice or whatever,
175101:33	you don't want --n402bfa to seem racist or prejudice or whatever,
175360:74	in other words you're saying that, w-, you have --n404597 to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were --n4045ce.
175379:45	see, wh-, when you're with a big company or a big organization --n40004e, a lot of times, uh, you know, the benefits are good
175382:38	and i, i think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that, that, uh, that anybody could get --n4003ff in, in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you, you get --n400466 to know what --n400479's going on --n40048c.
175450:86	and, and, but of course most time, most of the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who --n402e34 must know.
175482:64	but, uh, it --n4043c1's difficult for me to try --n4043e0 to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that.
175482:75	but, uh, it --n4043c1's difficult for me to try --n4043e0 to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that.
175520:134	there, there's a lot of times --n4007cb though, uh, you get those calls and, you know, when you're sitting at home wanting --n400832 to relax or, or whatnot --n400851 --n400858
175521:71	and, you know, next thing you know --n400a4f, uh, someone calls and wants --n400a72 to sell you this or that
175527:133	because, you know, if we don't want that to happen all we have --n400fbb to do --n400fca is just call the phone company and say, look, you know, i want my name unlisted or want my, you know,
175535:46	they get your name from, uh, if you enter any type of contest or anything.
175539:53	uh, you know, you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something,
175545:8	uh, or you, uh,
175546:14	or, or like the newspapers, they just dial randomly or s-, and stuff.
175624:181	but if the pers-, has, you know, their social s-, her social security number, i'd be real concerned that they, uh, that she's not, uh, blacklist --n403811 on, uh, tel-, what is it --n40383c, it's --n40384f telecredit or something.
175629:53	she probably won't be ab-, able --n403bb3 to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle.
175691:93	and i was thinking in the course of talking to him about it, how, uh, in world war two, the personalties of stalin, hitler and churchill more or less defined the war --n40153e
175985:81	you, you you were born --n40196b in, in the, in the late thirties or early forties.
175996:35	and, uh, my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house.
176020:91	and, and we put twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge. along with my trip to japan which --n402730 was, was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars
176088:46	i mean, certain things really do need --n404386 to be done --n404399 whether or not you think they should, be --n4043cc or not.
176088:77	i mean, certain things really do need --n404386 to be done --n404399 whether or not you think they should, be --n4043cc or not.
176099:48	we never really, you know, have --n404ce8 to program money for that or make choices, you know.
176223:59	the, uh, the first, uh, ten years, see first ten or twelve years, i stayed home.
176348:81	but where it's not necessary --n4011ae, uh, in that regard, where it's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property --n40120d uh, i, i'd, i would seriously question it.
176408:58	o-, o-, out here, i remember --n4030d3 hearing a year or so ago, that, uh, a lot of,
176410:14	o-, or, i shouldn't say high
176418:107	and e-, e-, essentially the first thing is t-, is on the order of mumblex paper in the urine and, uh, or some, you know,
176425:70	and then there's a, a much more, uh, uh, refined test, uh, uh, spectrography or whatever it's called --n403b9c --n403ba3. the chemo-, chemotography uh, --n403bd6 to determine exactly what the, what the things are --n403c05.
176448:17	they did that three or four years before they did it with everybody.
176508:24	i think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy.
176522:49	so it's just what i have --n4018d3 to do --n4018e2 --n4018e9 --n4018f0, more or less, around the house, you know, for my parents
176526:3	or was it stuff that --n401bf6 was already, uh, enclosed --n401c15.
176549:82	after we had the house part made --n4025ae, we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less.
176555:3	or did you build it up off the ground.
176571:3	or you did them yourself.
176611:31	that's not near, like building a house or anything
176630:3	or,
176653:15	it was about four or five hundred square feet.
176760:183	uh, and th-, and the problems that, that --n400fa1 has come that --n400fb8 has come from this decision that that jury came to --n400feb after all of us witnessed what we did --n401012 with the video tape beating. uh just makes you wonder i guess whether or not they,
176807:77	uh, i understand why they were upset --n4022d5 by the verdict --n4022e8 just because even those of us that --n40230b aren't black or, uh, don't live there or whatever, we all saw the same thing on the, on the tape
176807:97	uh, i understand why they were upset --n4022d5 by the verdict --n4022e8 just because even those of us that --n40230b aren't black or, uh, don't live there or whatever, we all saw the same thing on the, on the tape
176842:33	or just a by-, an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat --n4032e6 to death or what.
176842:57	or just a by-, an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat --n4032e6 to death or what.
176852:17	mumblex or, or beaten.
176953:48	they always like --n4014a9 to be able --n4014bc to attract the, uh, einsteins or the professor chou
176954:3	or, you know.
177175:54	and i don't feel like --n401864 going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever.
177200:3	or else you'd be out there --n402776 doing it.
177238:3	or, al-, also last summer i was doing nautilus
177239:3	or last year i'm, uh, belong to a club right here.
177320:23	things you already owned --n4003fd or things that you've picked --n40041c up just --n40042b to do that.
177325:3	or you pick them up just --n4005d2 to do that refinishing.
177352:25	maple top i think or or something of that sort.
