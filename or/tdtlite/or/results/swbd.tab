156862:107	uh, i think, i think one of the main things that --n4037cb's really important to spend money on --n4037f6 is education, not support or, or, research per se, but, but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed --n403871 out of the work place and out of society, you know, kind of like lepers would --n4038c4 you know		yes	yes	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	yes	S
156862:114	uh, i think, i think one of the main things that --n4037cb's really important to spend money on --n4037f6 is education, not support or, or, research per se, but, but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed --n403871 out of the work place and out of society, you know, kind of like lepers would --n4038c4 you know		yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S
156906:44	committing them mostly is, you know, either crimes of passion or at the moment		yes	yes	no	no	no	no	yes	no	yes	S
156907:3	or they think they're not going --n400bfe to get caught --n400c11	they	no	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S
156908:3	or,		no	no	no	no	no	no	no	no	no	S
156928:23	one, one way or another.	another	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	no	NP

156982:71	w-, w-, we're going --n403126 to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something.	something	yes	yes	no	no	yes	no	no	no	yes	S
156987:88	but you look at our, our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to, to like texas or someplace that --n403335 does, you know, it, it, it --n403378's impossible to make a case that it's, it's affecting it in any way.	someplace that --n403335 does, you know	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S
157011:154	and, you know, i, i think when you listen to like the, uh, the, the victims' families and things --n403f08, they're always talking about, you know, uh, --n403f3f feeling justified or feeling, you know, like they've gotten something out of it,	feeling, you know, like they've gotten something out of it	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S
157012:72	i mean, my thought has been, once the guy has been imprisoned --n404221, if he goes to jail forever or whatever, if he gets killed --n404260, it shouldn't make any difference to the, uh, the victim's family.	whatever	yes	yes	no	no	yes	no	no	no	yes	S
157037:38	and why, does it just turn out --n404db9 to be genetic or biochemical in origin --n404ddc.		yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	SBARQ

157474:125	and i, i don't think it --n401077 would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if, you know, six or seven voted not guilty, then instead of it being a hung jury, that was an acquittal.		yes	yes	no	no	no	yes	no	no	yes	S
157505:199	well, the people i know --n40242e who --n402439 have served have said that usually what --n40245c ends up --n40246b happening is that, you know, after initially finding out where people stand --n4024ae, that the whole deliberation usually results, if there is a, you know, something like a nine, three or, or more severe and, and the people in the majority trying --n40255d to convince the minority that they're right		yes	yes	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	yes	S

157511:153	well, the, the one thing that i know --n402ae2 does seem --n402af1 to happen from people i've talked to --n402b1c on this, is that in the situation you just said --n402b53 where it's nine to three, or some such number --n402b86, that there's, an effect --n402bad starts --n402bb8 being that there's starts --n402bd3 being a lot of peer pressure going on	some such number	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S
157526:224	some of them did say that, you know, when they were the only one left opposing the verdict --n403672, uh, you know, everyone was getting on them so, so heavily that eventually they just gave in --n4036cd knowing that nothing they could do --n4036f0 could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for --n403733 or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict.	a hung jury	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	yes	no	yes	S
